The police doesn't give much hard time to foreigners as they could to local people, but if you ever end up in a situation that you get pulled over by police, a bribe of 500k - 2mil will solve the problem for you! (try to put less money on yourself while driving - if you don't have an international permit; that way, you won't be ripped off by police!)

So yeah, it is a slight risk, but in my opinion, you should be safe even without an international permit, but if you don't want even that small risk, then get an international permit. Antonio is living for almost 9 months in Vietnam, and hasn't been pulled over by police even once for now. 

P.S. If you are by any means planning to visit Mui Ne/Phan Thiet; watch out the roads near the White Sand Dunes. The police love to pull over and bribe foreigners there!

He rides a 250cc and doesn't have a license (until last December). We ride almost every weekend and got pulled over by the police about once a year (mostly when we were speeding). If you're a foreigner riding in Vietnam, most of the time the police will just ignore you. Even if they stop you, they will most likely let you go (because they can't communicate with you anyway).

Regarding the question, it's definitely possible, depending on which routes you'd like to take.

We suggest to first do Hanoi, then Ha Giang Loop (including Sa Pa if you're thinking of heading there? Also, we would advise you to do Ha Giang - Cao Bang - Lang Son - Ha Long - Cat Ba). From there you can just continue to Ninh Binh and south.

It really depends on your pace! We did almost the same route without driving Ha Giang loop and it took us 1 month. Antonio was doing the trip from Saigon to Da Nang in 5 days through Central Highlands, so it really depends on your pace and how much of a place you'd like to experience and explore. 

We would recommend 1 - 1.5 month for all of it!

We got scammed twice and i can not move on because i can not accept the fact that it happened to us. Last June 9, we arrived in Saigon via Giant Ibis bus from Siem Reap. After the long travel, all we want is to reach the hotel ASAP and sleep. As soon as we unloaded our luggages, a taxi driver approached us and offering taxi by meter, so we agreed. He offered to pass by a money changer since we do not have VND yet but we refused and instructed to take us to the hotel directly, then he said ok.  I have a feeling that we will be scammed with this driver.  I am observing his taxi meter just jumping into different digits so quick, what i know is there will be a specific digit to be added for every meter travelled but his meter is erratic, clicking by 4.5 - 9 dongs with different distances. Surprisingly, since we are not familiar with the place, he stopped in a money changer which we agreed already not to do so, he was upset when i refused to change my dollars and he continued to drive passing by street by street pretending he is looking for our hotel. Finally, he found it and as we unload from the taxi he said the charge is 646,000 VND, and he converted it to $26. My husband argued with him because we did not travel that far and he should not charge us when he passed in the money changer.  To end the discussion, my husband gave him  $20 since it was the smallest denomination that i have. But still, we can not accept the fact that we knew that we got scammed! On the second day of our stay, while we are familiarizing ourselves in the area, i got a big surprise! the bus stop where the taxi driver loaded us is just across the street of our hotel, literally!! it can not be noticed quickly because there is a park in between the streets! 
the next one was when we are in the notre dame, my husband is taking photo of us when the ice cream vendor taught him of a better shot and volunteered to take pictures of us. after the shoot he insisted to buy from his ice creams, so i took 5 for all of us. To my surprise it cost me 200,000VND so i returned 1 which was not yet opened by my son. We walked away from him hurriedly bec of the expensive picture taking..had few bad experiences but it can not equate the beauty that we have seen in Saigon😍  ( i got the picture of the plate number of the taxi as a souvenir😁)","1","0","","0","403","","",""

Other information is either WRONG or IRRESPONSIBLE or both:

1) DO NOT try to run through a police stop!!! They can easily chase you and then you're in even more trouble.
2) DO NOT try to convince them you don't speak English; they use Google Translate.
3) I've been stopped MANY times and the ONLY time I had to pay was when I didn't have the required blue/yellow insurance card which you don't even mention.
4) You say you'll tell how to avoid the tourist traps, then you don't. AND, you tell people to dress like tourists. SHEESH!
5) You say, ""Always avoid tickets if you don’t have all the valid documents! That way, you’re 100% sure that you didn’t do anything wrong in the traffic."" What does that even mean? I hope you don't teach ""English"".
6) You say to avoid the traffic stops by going a different way. You forget to mention how you know there's a traffic stop on your route. If your answer is to turn around when you see the police, most people I know who've tried that get chased and pulled over, resulting in a bigger fine.

Ignorant as we were we parked there. First time at 20000 per bike (forgot to negotiate price up front), second time 10000 per bike. We didn't lose much money with it, but still it frustrates me that I fell for it twice! Second time they became aggressive to us when they found out we told other people they could park closer to the attraction.

Now we know better and we'll always drive towards the attraction until we can't go further. And then ask there.

The money changing I experienced the other way around. I was buying a bottle of water for 20000. I gave a 50000 bill. She said I had to wait for change. Then went somewhere inside and let me wait. She came back with a lot of bills. Then giving me back 100000, another 100000, etc.  I could have made a huge profit, but I don't want to steel from poor people so I pointed at the 50000 bill I gave here. Then she gave me back correct. That's where I learned these bills can be very confusing, even for the locals. Strange experience.","1","0","","0","638","false","",""

I believe the cheapest option would be to go to Laos, and come back to Vietnam if you have the exemption. I'm really not sure about how exemptions work and can you get a new one just after you left the country. I don't have an exemption, so every time I have to acquire a visa letter.

First went to a foreign exchange desk at the airport, didn’t think twice about it because it was at the airport and it felt like a legit place. They quickly type in the exchange in the calculator without you seeing the rate, count the bills, and you’re off on your way, almost pushing you out of their store...only realizing later you were getting a horrible horrible rate. 

Then looking for a taxi a fake grab driver says he can get me to my location and I just have to pay the grab rate. I agree since I use grab all the time back home, and since I don’t have internet I see the rate from his phone. I get in the car. I don’t have internet so he hands me his phone to put in my destination. 545k pops up in the app, I think, that’s a lot for the distance I’m going but agree to it. I’m exhausted after my flight and don’t have the mental awareness to convert the huge numbers of the currency here. After getting out and finding WiFi, I look at the grab rate to the airport on my own phone. 85k!!!! He had his phone preset to show the most expensive grab option possible. A clever and cunning scam.  Don’t fall for what I just fell for, an expensive lesson. I had my guard down, coming from Bangkok where this is much less common, and much more obvious when it happens. Just want to warn other travelers.","1","0","","0","1445","false","",""

After he shows me his room where he practices his art. Starts telling me how he can work with someone to scam a business man he knows. I know by now I'm in the middle of something bad, and trying to figure out how I'm going to get out. Eventually, he pulls 2000 dollars from his wallet and says I can use this to help him scam this guy. I told him sorry, I never gamble for money. He tries a few more times, then gives up. Next thing I'm in a taxi heading back.

Thanks for your comment.

As far as I know, you should still get out every 90 days, but you don't need a new invitation letter, just a stamp. However, you'll need a new entry visa to the country you're going to. Check the visa policies of the country you're going to. 

Currently, the borders are closed and if you get out you might not be able to get back in, so my advice is to contact a reputable visa agent (we're using services from Lynn in Da Nang) and talk directly to them.

Stay safe and wish you all the best.","1","1912","","3","1960","false","",""

Stay safe! We will go through it. :)","1","1958","","3","1961","false","",""
