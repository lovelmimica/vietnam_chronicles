215,"Complete Guide to Bai Tho Mountain (Updated 2019)","Bai Tho mountain is a huge limestone that stands at the beginning of the bay just in the middle of Halong Bay city.

If you're somehow like me, a person who loves to experience beautiful places, but doesn't want to be around a hundred tourists in small boat tour, then this article is for you!

I was wondering if there is any way to have Halong Bay only for myself. If you add a small budget to that equation, it seems like an impossible thing, but better, believe me, I found a way and it's called Bai Tho mountain!

<h2><strong>Hanoi to Halong Bay by Bus </strong></h2>
[caption id=""attachment_1141"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""540""]<img class=""wp-image-1141 size-full"" src=""http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/29341646_950182588491306_1156950490_n.jpg"" alt=""Never ending bus ride to Ha Long Bay"" width=""540"" height=""720"" /> The ride on the normal bus (referring to the bus that is not a sleeper bus) is very tough and uncomfortable. Usually, it's a bit overcrowded and people are sitting on the way between the seats. Another thing is that these buses smell really bad and the drivers will just drop you off in the middle of nowhere where taxi drivers will wait.[/caption]

There are so many tours and agencies that are specialized in the tours from Hanoi to Halong Bay. In my opinion, taking a tour isn't very expensive and it will cost you <strong>around 200,000 dongs (around $10)</strong>, but if you want to go on the budget, then the bus is the better option.

The buses from <strong>My Dinh bus station to Halong Bay</strong> bus station costs a bit lower than 100,000 dongs. It won't be that significantly cheaper and I guess the value isn't near these private shuttles, but at least, you can have food for a day in Halong Bay for that money!

If you're located somewhere outside the Old Quarter in Hanoi, the best way to go around is by taking a local bus that costs 7,000 dongs in one direction. Alternatively, I was using Grab so much which is very convenient and cheap compared to regular taxis (Uber in Vietnam).

So, if you choose to visit Halong Bay from Hanoi by bus, then I recommend you to check out their official bus schedule and site <strong><a href=""https://vexere.com/en-US"">Vexere</a></strong> for details. It seems there is a bus line every three hours to Halong Bay, so you're quite flexible.

The bus ride will take around <strong>4 - 5 hours with one stop</strong> where you could take a snack or beer to refresh yourself.

Also, don't forget to check our complete <a href=""http://vietnamchronicles.com/public-transportation-in-vietnam""><strong>public transport guide about Vietnam</strong></a>. There are some golden tips that can save you time and money while traveling around the country.

<strong><em>Note:</em> </strong>The bus isn't the most comfortable one and it smells pretty bad, but at least you'll get an authentic experience and a few bucks saved! :)

<strong><em>Note 2:</em> </strong>Don't get scammed by a bus driver who will tell you to get outside the bus before the station. They will leave you in the middle of nowhere on the main road and that place will be overcrowded by taxi drivers. That's a nice way to make some money! But again, it's very easy to bargain! Never ever accept the first price, especially from taxi drivers as they will usually change their mind pretty fast!

When I was traveling back to Hanoi, I took another bus which was kind of VIP with one stop on the market. The bus was very nice and comfortable with only a few passengers and the trip lasted around 4 hours. The price was 100,000 dongs and pay attention to the type of the bus (<strong>look for VIP buses</strong>).
<h2><strong>Best Time to Climb Bai Tho Mountain</strong></h2>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1158 size-large"" src=""http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC05214-1024x681.jpg"" alt=""Halong Bay in March"" width=""1024"" height=""681"" />

Well, if you're looking for good weather and you don't want to share this beautiful wonder with millions of tourists, the best seasons tend to be <strong>Spring (March and April) and Fall (September, October).</strong>

I visited it at the end of the March and it seems like a perfect time as the weather was pretty nice, there weren't many tourists around and prices were just a bit higher than in Hanoi. You can experience temperatures around <strong>20 - 25C in March</strong> which is completely fine if you ask me. I just wanted to add the fact that a visit to Halong Bay was just a few days after I left cold and snowy Croatia!

We climbed Bai Tho mountain twice, to watch a sunset and sunrise. Sunset was a bit misty and foggy which makes a trail a bit slippery, so be careful! When it comes to sunrise, it's extremely clear without many clouds and you can see thousands of limestones in the bay!

When it comes to food, drinks, and accommodation, I was astonished by our hostel price that was only <strong>300,000 dongs (around $13) per night</strong>. The hostel was located on the main street and we had the luck to be on the fifth floor overlooking an infinite number of limestones!

Food was a bit pricier than in Hanoi and the portions weren't so significant. I mainly ate their Banh Mi and Pho. For a can of beer in the town, expect to pay around 30,000 dongs (around $1.3).

Anyway, during the stay, I can't say anything was overpriced or I experienced hordes of tourists, but I noticed <strong>slightly higher prices compared to Hanoi</strong> which shouldn't hurt your wallet that much.
<h2><strong>How to Find and Climb Bai Tho Mountain</strong></h2>
[caption id=""attachment_1145"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]<img class=""wp-image-1145 size-large"" src=""http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC05533-1024x681.jpg"" alt=""Alternative way to experience Ha Long Bay"" width=""1024"" height=""681"" /> Well, before I did any planning, I was told by so many people to take a boat tour and that would be the best way to experience Halong Bay. At first, I was thinking of getting on a tour, but after some research, I find out that it's usually overcrowded and you don't get the value for the money you pay.[/caption]

<em>The last thing I wanted was sharing the boat with hundreds of tourists!</em>

Luckily, on my arrival in Hanoi, I met an amazing guy Bryan from the Philippines and we shared a similar opinion when it comes to the way of traveling - we were looking for memorable experiences.

We headed to Halong Bay absolutely not having an idea what to do and see. We only knew that we were heading to a breathtaking natural wonder.

Before we arrived, Bryan stumbled upon a post on Instagram from one upcoming travel blogger with the alternative view on Halong Bay. We instantly agreed that we're going there!

The place is called <strong>Bai Tho Mountain</strong> (the view really gives you much inspiration!).

<em>See on the map below how to find the mountain:</em>

<iframe style=""border: 0;"" src=""https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d14904.62690776757!2d107.0788694!3d20.9462203!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0xe60e88af13062a43!2sPoem+Mountain!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1553428679934"" width=""600"" height=""450"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>

It's amazing that this mountain is located in the residual area, but it's not a very known place as there is no signs or nothing that could tell you where and how to climb it!

<em>Here comes the most interesting part...</em>

You need to navigate the doors of the local house and you basically walk through their house (very warm people) to set your feet on the hiking trail that will lead you to the top.

If you thought you would pass through someone's house for free, you'd be very wrong! We're in Vietnam baby! The funny thing is that when these locals show you the way to their backyard, they will start to wave with <em>50,000 dongs</em> which mean <strong><em>""Give me 50k to climb!"".</em></strong>

<em><strong>Note: </strong></em>Later, we found out that there is a house on the left and the owners will let you through for 25k! :)

We went there twice to catch the sunset and sunrise. The sunrise absolutely blew away our minds and the most interesting thing is that only four people in total were there catching the sunrise. It means a whole Halong Bay for us for only $2! :)

<em>Alright, now then you have a location and know the details, I bet it's time for pictures to show you how that hike and view actually looked alike! </em>

<h2><strong>Where to Stay in Halong Bay</strong></h2>
[caption id=""attachment_1143"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]<img class=""wp-image-1143 size-large"" src=""http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/29634483_950181808491384_1770541657_o-1024x768.jpg"" alt=""View of Ha Long Bay from the hostel"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" /> A view from the fifth floor of our hostel. Always ask for the fifth floor as you will have a huge balcony for yourself with the view like this! And not to forget, it only costs $13 for a double room.[/caption]

There are many options to stay in Halong Bay, especially when tourists start to arrive (<strong>around May</strong>). I went for a budget option again, renting a hostel on the main street in Halong Bay city.

The name of the hostel is Halong Bay View Hostel and it acts as a backpacker hub there. The hostel has a small pub with billiards and a restaurant where you could order a coffee, tea or western food.

<strong>Budget advice: <a href=""http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget"">Traveling around Vietnam on $20 per day!</a></strong>

The coffee is decent, but I make better sandwiches then they serve there, so my genuine advice is not to eat there (sorry guys!).

I had luck to have a room on the fifth floor with a huge balcony. The room had everything needed and it was clean.

The funniest thing was that in Hanoi I slept on a very hard mattress that feels like you're sleeping on the floor and I was so happy to finally sleep on a REAL bed, but only slept three hours there! The urge to catch the sunrise on Halong Bay was much stronger than the comfort of the bed this time!

[caption id=""attachment_1144"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]<img class=""wp-image-1144 size-large"" src=""http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/29526678_950182308491334_2026605498_o-1024x768.jpg"" alt=""Ha Long Backpacker hostel"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" /> A view of the hostel from the street. It has a bar and breakfast included in the price. The breakfast is nothing special, but still, any food is better than no food! :)[/caption]

I was so amazed by the view I had from the room. Literally, you could see Halong Bay from the balcony drinking a beer! Also, the price was surprisingly low and it <strong>costs only $13 for a night</strong> in two-bedroom with breakfast included.

However, as I find out later from a German girl, it wasn't that cheap as she paid around $20 for a night in a nice hotel room with two beds. But anyway, six dollars won't be that hard on your wallet!

<h2><strong>Where to Stay in Halong Bay</strong></h2>

Always ask for the fifth floor as you will have a huge balcony for yourself with the view like this! And not to forget, it only costs $13 for a double room.[/caption]

There are many options to stay in Halong Bay, especially when tourists start to arrive (<strong>around May</strong>). I went for a budget option again, renting a hostel on the main street in Halong Bay city.

The name of the hostel is Halong Bay View Hostel and it acts as a backpacker hub there. The hostel has a small pub with billiards and a restaurant where you could order a coffee, tea or western food.

<strong>Budget advice: <a href=""http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget"">Traveling around Vietnam on $20 per day!</a></strong>

The coffee is decent, but I make better sandwiches then they serve there, so my genuine advice is not to eat there (sorry guys!).

I had luck to have a room on the fifth floor with a huge balcony. The room had everything needed and it was clean.

The funniest thing was that in Hanoi I slept on a very hard mattress that feels like you're sleeping on the floor and I was so happy to finally sleep on a REAL bed, but only slept three hours there! The urge to catch the sunrise on Halong Bay was much stronger than the comfort of the bed this time!

[caption id=""attachment_1144"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]<img class=""wp-image-1144 size-large"" src=""http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/29526678_950182308491334_2026605498_o-1024x768.jpg"" alt=""Ha Long Backpacker hostel"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" /> A view of the hostel from the street. It has a bar and breakfast included in the price. The breakfast is nothing special, but still, any food is better than no food! :)[/caption]

I was so amazed by the view I had from the room. Literally, you could see Halong Bay from the balcony drinking a beer! Also, the price was surprisingly low and it <strong>costs only $13 for a night</strong> in two-bedroom with breakfast included.

However, as I find out later from a German girl, it wasn't that cheap as she paid around $20 for a night in a nice hotel room with two beds. But anyway, six dollars won't be that hard on your wallet!

226,"A Guide to Vietnamese Drip Coffee","For true coffee lovers, Vietnam will be just an ideal destination. One of the first things I noticed was the way Vietnamese respect their coffee breaks. Their culture is so strong as well as their coffee and they have so many different coffees to try! Such an amazing country if you love your coffee strong and diverse!

One of the easiest, but very tasty and strong coffee to prepare is a Vietnamese drip coffee. When you walk around the city, you can see people sitting on their tiny chairs and sipping their coffee. Almost every home has the equipment for making a tasty drip coffee.

When I tried it the first time, I immediately got hooked and now I'm the part of their coffee culture - drinking a few strong coffees per day, no matter the time.

No matter where you're in the world, you should get ingredients and equipment, so you could be always ready for one shot of Vietnamese coffee! Also, it's easy to get your hands on the filter and it's highly portable as dimensions are very small. It makes a coffee filter and coffee the portable and delicious <strong><a href=""http://vietnamchronicles.com/souvenirs-from-vietnam"">Vietnamese souvenir</a></strong> you should bring home.
<h2><strong>Vietnamese Coffee Culture Is So Strong!</strong></h2>

You may ask why Vietnamese people have such a strong culture and variety when it comes to coffee.

Well, if we look a bit in the history, it's not a strange thing why <a href=""https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-coffee-culture"">Vietnamese culture is revolving around the coffee</a>. The country is the second producer of coffee in the world!

As the country was a French colony, it was brought to Vietnam <a href=""https://vina.com/cafe/"">during the 19th century</a> and since then, the government focuses so much effort on producing more and more.

Right now, Vietnam is producing a whopping <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25811724"">2 million tons annually</a> and the number is growing with each year.

Vietnamese people usually lead a laid-back lifestyle which means many coffee breaks. It's not a coincidence to see them on the street or coffee shops enjoying their coffee, no matter of the time.

<strong>Expand your knowledge: <a href=""http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam"">Learn about Vietnamese culture!</a></strong>

It was a really funny experience when I saw many small chairs set up on the street with Vietnamese people sitting on them while enjoying their coffee. And yeah, it was night time already.

They have so many different options when it comes to coffee and it's really hard to choose. I rarely drank bad coffee there.

I tried a regular drip coffee (iced and hot), coffee with condensed milk (their regular one), coconut coffee, yogurt coffee and strongest black coffee I've ever had.

<strong>Each one of these blew me away, but still, I really stick to drip coffee for various reasons:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>our host family has the equipment at home, so it's easy and convenient to brew it.</li>
 	<li>the whole process takes around <strong>10 minutes</strong> (they really love to take your time on every action they do).</li>
 	<li>it's tasty, strong and keeps you alert and awake!</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to Brew Vietnamese Drip Coffee At Home?</strong></h2>
Maybe it sounds complicated as there is a whole process behind it, but believe me, once you get used to it, it just becomes a nice routine!

So, I will share with you the process of making a Vietnamese black coffee with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_milk"">condensed milk</a>. You could add ice or leave it black.

Anyway, if you're a coffee addict, you will definitely fall in love with this coffee and the whole process of preparation.

<em>Let's start!</em>
<h3>1. Pick the right coffee beans and brand of coffee</h3>
I'm not sure about the coffee around the world, but in Vietnam, I'm using <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Trung-Nguyen-Vietnamese-coffee-can/dp/B000F17AKC/?tag=calisequipzon-20"">Trung Nguyen coffee</a>. Many people tell amazing things about this coffee and I think it's not a coincidence that you can find a bag of these beans in every household.

If you're not in Vietnam, then my advice is to try to get that coffee brand online. <em>Don't worry if you can't get it as there are many alternatives:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>use any dark roast coffee</li>
 	<li>medium coarse ground coffee will do just fine</li>
 	<li>any Robusta brand will make the work</li>
</ul>
<h3><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-1132"" src=""http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_6278-e1541324921612-768x1024.jpg"" alt=""Trung Nguyen coffee brand in Vietnam"" width=""768"" height=""1024"" /></h3>
<h3>2. Make sure that you have the equipment (Phins)</h3>
Once you get your hands on the perfect coffee, it's time to find the right equipment that will help you in brewing the ideal coffee.

In Vietnam, it's called a <em>Phin</em> and it refers to a small metal cup, filter and lid. You put these three on the top of the cup and simply wait. You can literally see each drip dropping down in your cup while enjoying your time.

<img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-1133"" src=""http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_6050-1024x768.jpg"" alt=""Coffee phin and other equipment for Vietnamese coffee"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" />

It's very easy to get Vietnamese coffee filter and I recommend you to <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Vietnamese-Coffee-Filter-Gravity-Insert/dp/B01AK11S7C/?tag=calisequipzon-20"">check this one</a>!
<h3><strong>3. Preparation process</strong></h3>
Once you have a coffee, Phin and filter, you're ready to brew your first Vietnamese coffee at home!

It will take around 10 minutes, but don't worry, Vietnamese love to do everything slowly. Just enjoy and relax a bit, it's good for your health!

<img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-1134"" src=""http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_6054-1024x768.jpg"" alt=""Phin filled with delicious coffee"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" />

First, fill the Phin with a desired amount of coffee. I usually put around 4 small spoons, but you can do even more. Vietnamese people usually fill more than half of the Phin!
<p id=""PJxWxmg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-752 aligncenter"" src=""http://balkandigitalnomads.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ac72de50e132.png"" alt="""" /></p>
Put the Phin at the top of the glass/cup.

<img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-1135"" src=""http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_6060-1024x768.jpg"" alt=""Put the filter in the phin."" width=""1024"" height=""768"" />

Once you put a desired amount of coffee inside a Phin, just put the filter on top.

<em><strong>You're ready for the showtime now!</strong></em>

Fill the Phin with boiled water, sit back and relax while every drop of tasty coffee is dropping down to your cup. It will take some time, but it's enjoyable, especially when you're surrounded by nice people!
<p id=""wiNcCuL""><img class=""size-full wp-image-755 aligncenter"" src=""http://balkandigitalnomads.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ac72edb26328.png"" alt="""" /></p>
Once all the water is gone, simply press the filter to get the last drips into your cup and you're almost ready!
<h3><strong>4. Iced, hot or coffee with condensed milk?</strong></h3>
Now, it's time to choose the way you'd like to drink your coffee.

You can easily add ice or leave it just as it is. I usually put some condensed milk (it's very sweet!) and sometimes ice when it's hot outside.

I found out that my favorite is iced coffee with condensed milk!

Try out different coffees to find out your favorite!

Enjoy your coffee!
