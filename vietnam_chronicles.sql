Another thing is that these buses smell really bad and the drivers will just drop you off in the middle of nowhere where taxi drivers will wait.[/caption]\n\nThere are so many tours and agencies that are specialized in the tours from Hanoi to Halong Bay. In my opinion, taking a tour isn\'t very expensive and it will cost you <strong>around 200,000 dongs (around $10)</strong>, but if you want to go on the budget, then the bus is the better option.\n\nThe buses from <strong>My Dinh bus station to Halong Bay</strong> bus station costs a bit lower than 100,000 dongs. It won\'t be that significantly cheaper and I guess the value isn\'t near these private shuttles, but at least, you can have food for a day in Halong Bay for that money!\n\n<div data-gyg-href=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/default/activites.frame\" data-gyg-locale-code=\"en-US\" data-gyg-widget=\"activities\" data-gyg-number-of-items=\"3\" data-gyg-currency=\"USD\" data-gyg-partner-id=\"781AB6P\" data-gyg-q=\"Hanoi to Halong Bay\"></div><script async defer src=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js\"></script>\n\n<strong>Learn more: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam\">Cultural shocks you will experience in Vietnam (and other SEAn countries!)</a></strong>\n\nIf you\'re located somewhere outside the Old Quarter in Hanoi, the best way to go around is by taking a local bus that costs 7,000 dongs in one direction. Alternatively, I was using Grab so much which is very convenient and cheap compared to regular taxis (Uber in Vietnam).\n\nSo, if you choose to visit Halong Bay from Hanoi by bus, then I recommend you to check out their official bus schedule and site <strong><a href=\"https://vexere.com/en-US\">Vexere</a></strong> for details. It seems there is a bus line every three hours to Halong Bay, so you\'re quite flexible.\n\nThe bus ride will take around <strong>4 - 5 hours with one stop</strong> where you could take a snack or beer to refresh yourself.\n\nAlso, don\'t forget to check our complete <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/public-transportation-in-vietnam\"><strong>public transport guide about Vietnam</strong></a>. There are some golden tips that can save you time and money while traveling around the country.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1142\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"540\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1142 size-full\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/29547340_950182591824639_1956733929_n-1.jpg\" alt=\"Bia Hanoi in the country side\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /> A local beer from Ha Noi is always a good choice to refresh yourself on the bus stops![/caption]\n\n<strong><em>Note:</em> </strong>The bus isn\'t the most comfortable one and it smells pretty bad, but at least you\'ll get an authentic experience and a few bucks saved! :)\n\n<strong><em>Note 2:</em> </strong>Don\'t get scammed by a bus driver who will tell you to get outside the bus before the station. They will leave you in the middle of nowhere on the main road and that place will be overcrowded by taxi drivers. That\'s a nice way to make some money! But again, it\'s very easy to bargain! Never ever accept the first price, especially from taxi drivers as they will usually change their mind pretty fast!\n\nWhen I was traveling back to Hanoi, I took another bus which was kind of VIP with one stop on the market. The bus was very nice and comfortable with only a few passengers and the trip lasted around 4 hours. The price was 100,000 dongs and pay attention to the type of the bus (<strong>look for VIP buses</strong>).\n<h2><strong>Best Time to Climb Bai Tho Mountain</strong></h2>\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1158 size-large\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC05214-1024x681.jpg\" alt=\"Halong Bay in March\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" />\n\nWell, if you\'re looking for good weather and you don\'t want to share this beautiful wonder with millions of tourists, the best seasons tend to be <strong>Spring (March and April) and Fall (September, October).</strong>\n\nI visited it at the end of the March and it seems like a perfect time as the weather was pretty nice, there weren\'t many tourists around and prices were just a bit higher than in Hanoi. You can experience temperatures around <strong>20 - 25C in March</strong> which is completely fine if you ask me. I just wanted to add the fact that a visit to Halong Bay was just a few days after I left cold and snowy Croatia!\n\nWe climbed Bai Tho mountain twice, to watch a sunset and sunrise. Sunset was a bit misty and foggy which makes a trail a bit slippery, so be careful! When it comes to sunrise, it\'s extremely clear without many clouds and you can see thousands of limestones in the bay!\n\nWhen it comes to food, drinks, and accommodation, I was astonished by our hostel price that was only <strong>300,000 dongs (around $13) per night</strong>. The hostel was located on the main street and we had the luck to be on the fifth floor overlooking an infinite number of limestones!\n\nFood was a bit pricier than in Hanoi and the portions weren\'t so significant. I mainly ate their Banh Mi and Pho. For a can of beer in the town, expect to pay around 30,000 dongs (around $1.3).\n\nAnyway, during the stay, I can\'t say anything was overpriced or I experienced hordes of tourists, but I noticed <strong>slightly higher prices compared to Hanoi</strong> which shouldn\'t hurt your wallet that much.\n<h2><strong>How to Find and Climb Bai Tho Mountain</strong></h2>\n[caption id=\"attachment_1145\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1145 size-large\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC05533-1024x681.jpg\" alt=\"Alternative way to experience Ha Long Bay\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" /> Well, before I did any planning, I was told by so many people to take a boat tour and that would be the best way to experience Halong Bay. At first, I was thinking of getting on a tour, but after some research, I find out that it\'s usually overcrowded and you don\'t get the value for the money you pay.[/caption]\n\n<em>The last thing I wanted was sharing the boat with hundreds of tourists!</em>\n\nLuckily, on my arrival in Hanoi, I met an amazing guy Bryan from the Philippines and we shared a similar opinion when it comes to the way of traveling - we were looking for memorable experiences.\n\nWe headed to Halong Bay absolutely not having an idea what to do and see. We only knew that we were heading to a breathtaking natural wonder.\n\nBefore we arrived, Bryan stumbled upon a post on Instagram from one upcoming travel blogger with the alternative view on Halong Bay. We instantly agreed that we\'re going there!\n\nThe place is called <strong>Bai Tho Mountain</strong> (the view really gives you much inspiration!).\n\n<em>See on the map below how to find the mountain:</em>\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d14904.62690776757!2d107.0788694!3d20.9462203!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0xe60e88af13062a43!2sPoem+Mountain!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1553428679934\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nIt\'s amazing that this mountain is located in the residual area, but it\'s not a very known place as there is no signs or nothing that could tell you where and how to climb it!\n\n<em>Here comes the most interesting part...</em>\n\nYou need to navigate the doors of the local house and you basically walk through their house (very warm people) to set your feet on the hiking trail that will lead you to the top.\n\nIf you thought you would pass through someone\'s house for free, you\'d be very wrong! We\'re in Vietnam baby! The funny thing is that when these locals show you the way to their backyard, they will start to wave with <em>50,000 dongs</em> which mean <strong><em>\"Give me 50k to climb!\".</em></strong>\n\n<em><strong>Note: </strong></em>Later, we found out that there is a house on the left and the owners will let you through for 25k! :)\n\nWe went there twice to catch the sunset and sunrise. The sunrise absolutely blew away our minds and the most interesting thing is that only four people in total were there catching the sunrise. It means a whole Halong Bay for us for only $2! :)\n\n<em>Alright, now then you have a location and know the details, I bet it\'s time for pictures to show you how that hike and view actually looked alike! </em>\n\nIf you\'re looking for more stunning adventures and don\'t want to share the place with thousands of tourists, we advise you to check the <a href=\"https://www.asabbatical.com/article/visit-ha-long-bay\"><strong>most breathtaking bays in Vietnam</strong></a>.\n\n<hr />\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1146\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1146 size-large\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_5947-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Bai Tho mountain from the street\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /> You need to climb to the top of that limestone, but don\'t worry, the hike isn\'t that tough.

And not to forget, it only costs $13 for a double room.[/caption]\n\nThere are many options to stay in Halong Bay, especially when tourists start to arrive (<strong>around May</strong>). I went for a budget option again, renting a hostel on the main street in Halong Bay city.\n\nThe name of the hostel is Halong Bay View Hostel and it acts as a backpacker hub there. The hostel has a small pub with billiards and a restaurant where you could order a coffee, tea or western food.\n\n<strong>Budget advice: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget\">Traveling around Vietnam on $20 per day!</a></strong>\n\nThe coffee is decent, but I make better sandwiches then they serve there, so my genuine advice is not to eat there (sorry guys!).\n\nI had luck to have a room on the fifth floor with a huge balcony. The room had everything needed and it was clean.\n\nThe funniest thing was that in Hanoi I slept on a very hard mattress that feels like you\'re sleeping on the floor and I was so happy to finally sleep on a REAL bed, but only slept three hours there! The urge to catch the sunrise on Halong Bay was much stronger than the comfort of the bed this time!\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1144\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1144 size-large\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/29526678_950182308491334_2026605498_o-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Ha Long Backpacker hostel\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /> A view of the hostel from the street. It has a bar and breakfast included in the price. The breakfast is nothing special, but still, any food is better than no food! :)[/caption]\n\nI was so amazed by the view I had from the room. Literally, you could see Halong Bay from the balcony drinking a beer! Also, the price was surprisingly low and it <strong>costs only $13 for a night</strong> in two-bedroom with breakfast included.\n\nHowever, as I find out later from a German girl, it wasn\'t that cheap as she paid around $20 for a night in a nice hotel room with two beds. But anyway, six dollars won\'t be that hard on your wallet!\n\n<hr />\n\nHope you enjoyed and if you have any additional questions, feel free to reach us out through<strong> <a href=\"http://balkandigitalnomads.com/contact/\">contact form</a></strong> or directly on social media!\n\nCheers, and wish you an amazing experience in Halong Bay! :\n\nbtw. are you looking for your next destination after stunning Halong Bay?

It won\'t be that significantly cheaper and I guess the value isn\'t near these private shuttles, but at least, you can have food for a day in Halong Bay for that money!\n\n<div data-gyg-href=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/default/activites.frame\" data-gyg-locale-code=\"en-US\" data-gyg-widget=\"activities\" data-gyg-number-of-items=\"3\" data-gyg-currency=\"USD\" data-gyg-partner-id=\"781AB6P\" data-gyg-q=\"Hanoi to Halong Bay\"></div><script async defer src=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js\"></script>\n\n<strong>Learn more: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam\">Cultural shocks you will experience in Vietnam (and other SEAn countries!)</a></strong>\n\nIf you\'re located somewhere outside the Old Quarter in Hanoi, the best way to go around is by taking a local bus that costs 7,000 dongs in one direction. Alternatively, I was using Grab so much which is very convenient and cheap compared to regular taxis (Uber in Vietnam).\n\nSo, if you choose to visit Halong Bay from Hanoi by bus, then I recommend you to check out their official bus schedule and site <strong><a href=\"https://vexere.com/en-US\">Vexere</a></strong> for details. It seems there is a bus line every three hours to Halong Bay, so you\'re quite flexible.\n\nThe bus ride will take around <strong>4 - 5 hours with one stop</strong> where you could take a snack or beer to refresh yourself.\n\nAlso, don\'t forget to check our complete <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/public-transportation-in-vietnam\"><strong>public transport guide about Vietnam</strong></a>. There are some golden tips that can save you time and money while traveling around the country.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1142\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"540\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1142 size-full\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/29547340_950182591824639_1956733929_n-1.jpg\" alt=\"Bia Hanoi in the country side\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /> A local beer from Ha Noi is always a good choice to refresh yourself on the bus stops![/caption]\n\n<strong><em>Note:</em> </strong>The bus isn\'t the most comfortable one and it smells pretty bad, but at least you\'ll get an authentic experience and a few bucks saved! :)\n\n<strong><em>Note 2:</em> </strong>Don\'t get scammed by a bus driver who will tell you to get outside the bus before the station. They will leave you in the middle of nowhere on the main road and that place will be overcrowded by taxi drivers. That\'s a nice way to make some money! But again, it\'s very easy to bargain! Never ever accept the first price, especially from taxi drivers as they will usually change their mind pretty fast!\n\nWhen I was traveling back to Hanoi, I took another bus which was kind of VIP with one stop on the market. The bus was very nice and comfortable with only a few passengers and the trip lasted around 4 hours. The price was 100,000 dongs and pay attention to the type of the bus (<strong>look for VIP buses</strong>).\n<h2><strong>Best Time to Climb Bai Tho Mountain</strong></h2>\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1158 size-large\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC05214-1024x681.jpg\" alt=\"Halong Bay in March\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" />\n\nWell, if you\'re looking for good weather and you don\'t want to share this beautiful wonder with millions of tourists, the best seasons tend to be <strong>Spring (March and April) and Fall (September, October).</strong>\n\nI visited it at the end of the March and it seems like a perfect time as the weather was pretty nice, there weren\'t many tourists around and prices were just a bit higher than in Hanoi. You can experience temperatures around <strong>20 - 25C in March</strong> which is completely fine if you ask me. I just wanted to add the fact that a visit to Halong Bay was just a few days after I left cold and snowy Croatia!\n\nWe climbed Bai Tho mountain twice, to watch a sunset and sunrise. Sunset was a bit misty and foggy which makes a trail a bit slippery, so be careful! When it comes to sunrise, it\'s extremely clear without many clouds and you can see thousands of limestones in the bay!\n\nWhen it comes to food, drinks, and accommodation, I was astonished by our hostel price that was only <strong>300,000 dongs (around $13) per night</strong>. The hostel was located on the main street and we had the luck to be on the fifth floor overlooking an infinite number of limestones!\n\nFood was a bit pricier than in Hanoi and the portions weren\'t so significant. I mainly ate their Banh Mi and Pho. For a can of beer in the town, expect to pay around 30,000 dongs (around $1.3).\n\nAnyway, during the stay, I can\'t say anything was overpriced or I experienced hordes of tourists, but I noticed <strong>slightly higher prices compared to Hanoi</strong> which shouldn\'t hurt your wallet that much.\n<h2><strong>How to Find and Climb Bai Tho Mountain</strong></h2>\n[caption id=\"attachment_1145\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1145 size-large\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC05533-1024x681.jpg\" alt=\"Alternative way to experience Ha Long Bay\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" /> Well, before I did any planning, I was told by so many people to take a boat tour and that would be the best way to experience Halong Bay. At first, I was thinking of getting on a tour, but after some research, I find out that it\'s usually overcrowded and you don\'t get the value for the money you pay.[/caption]\n\n<em>The last thing I wanted was sharing the boat with hundreds of tourists!</em>\n\nLuckily, on my arrival in Hanoi, I met an amazing guy Bryan from the Philippines and we shared a similar opinion when it comes to the way of traveling - we were looking for memorable experiences.\n\nWe headed to Halong Bay absolutely not having an idea what to do and see. We only knew that we were heading to a breathtaking natural wonder.\n\nBefore we arrived, Bryan stumbled upon a post on Instagram from one upcoming travel blogger with the alternative view on Halong Bay. We instantly agreed that we\'re going there!\n\nThe place is called <strong>Bai Tho Mountain</strong> (the view really gives you much inspiration!).\n\n<em>See on the map below how to find the mountain:</em>\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d14904.62690776757!2d107.0788694!3d20.9462203!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0xe60e88af13062a43!2sPoem+Mountain!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1553428679934\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nIt\'s amazing that this mountain is located in the residual area, but it\'s not a very known place as there is no signs or nothing that could tell you where and how to climb it!\n\n<em>Here comes the most interesting part...</em>\n\nYou need to navigate the doors of the local house and you basically walk through their house (very warm people) to set your feet on the hiking trail that will lead you to the top.\n\nIf you thought you would pass through someone\'s house for free, you\'d be very wrong! We\'re in Vietnam baby! The funny thing is that when these locals show you the way to their backyard, they will start to wave with <em>50,000 dongs</em> which mean <strong><em>\"Give me 50k to climb!\".</em></strong>\n\n<em><strong>Note: </strong></em>Later, we found out that there is a house on the left and the owners will let you through for 25k! :)\n\nWe went there twice to catch the sunset and sunrise. The sunrise absolutely blew away our minds and the most interesting thing is that only four people in total were there catching the sunrise. It means a whole Halong Bay for us for only $2! :)\n\n<em>Alright, now then you have a location and know the details, I bet it\'s time for pictures to show you how that hike and view actually looked alike! </em>\n\nIf you\'re looking for more stunning adventures and don\'t want to share the place with thousands of tourists, we advise you to check the <a href=\"https://www.asabbatical.com/article/visit-ha-long-bay\"><strong>most breathtaking bays in Vietnam</strong></a>.\n\n<hr />\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1146\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1146 size-large\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_5947-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Bai Tho mountain from the street\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /> You need to climb to the top of that limestone, but don\'t worry, the hike isn\'t that tough.

And not to forget, it only costs $13 for a double room.[/caption]\n\nThere are many options to stay in Halong Bay, especially when tourists start to arrive (<strong>around May</strong>). I went for a budget option again, renting a hostel on the main street in Halong Bay city.\n\nThe name of the hostel is Halong Bay View Hostel and it acts as a backpacker hub there. The hostel has a small pub with billiards and a restaurant where you could order a coffee, tea or western food.\n\n<strong>Budget advice: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget\">Traveling around Vietnam on $20 per day!</a></strong>\n\nThe coffee is decent, but I make better sandwiches then they serve there, so my genuine advice is not to eat there (sorry guys!).\n\nI had luck to have a room on the fifth floor with a huge balcony. The room had everything needed and it was clean.\n\nThe funniest thing was that in Hanoi I slept on a very hard mattress that feels like you\'re sleeping on the floor and I was so happy to finally sleep on a REAL bed, but only slept three hours there! The urge to catch the sunrise on Halong Bay was much stronger than the comfort of the bed this time!\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1144\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1144 size-large\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/29526678_950182308491334_2026605498_o-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Ha Long Backpacker hostel\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /> A view of the hostel from the street. It has a bar and breakfast included in the price. The breakfast is nothing special, but still, any food is better than no food! :)[/caption]\n\nI was so amazed by the view I had from the room. Literally, you could see Halong Bay from the balcony drinking a beer! Also, the price was surprisingly low and it <strong>costs only $13 for a night</strong> in two-bedroom with breakfast included.\n\nHowever, as I find out later from a German girl, it wasn\'t that cheap as she paid around $20 for a night in a nice hotel room with two beds. But anyway, six dollars won\'t be that hard on your wallet!\n\n<hr />\n\nHope you enjoyed and if you have any additional questions, feel free to reach us out through<strong> <a href=\"http://balkandigitalnomads.com/contact/\">contact form</a></strong> or directly on social media!\n\nCheers, and wish you an amazing experience in Halong Bay! :\n\nbtw. are you looking for your next destination after stunning Halong Bay?

One of the first things I noticed was the way Vietnamese respect their coffee breaks. Their culture is so strong as well as their coffee and they have so many different coffees to try! Such an amazing country if you love your coffee strong and diverse!\n\nOne of the easiest, but very tasty and strong coffee to prepare is a Vietnamese drip coffee. When you walk around the city, you can see people sitting on their tiny chairs and sipping their coffee. Almost every home has the equipment for making a tasty drip coffee.\n\nWhen I tried it the first time, I immediately got hooked and now I\'m the part of their coffee culture - drinking a few strong coffees per day, no matter the time.\n\nNo matter where you\'re in the world, you should get ingredients and equipment, so you could be always ready for one shot of Vietnamese coffee! Also, it\'s easy to get your hands on the filter and it\'s highly portable as dimensions are very small. It makes a coffee filter and coffee the portable and delicious <strong><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/souvenirs-from-vietnam\">Vietnamese souvenir</a></strong> you should bring home.\n<h2><strong>Vietnamese Coffee Culture Is So Strong!</strong></h2>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1131\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vietnamese-coffee-culutre-1024x668.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnamese drip coffee culture\" width=\"1024\" height=\"668\" />\n\nYou may ask why Vietnamese people have such a strong culture and variety when it comes to coffee.\n\nWell, if we look a bit in the history, it\'s not a strange thing why <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-coffee-culture\">Vietnamese culture is revolving around the coffee</a>. The country is the second producer of coffee in the world!\n\nAs the country was a French colony, it was brought to Vietnam <a href=\"https://vina.com/cafe/\">during the 19th century</a> and since then, the government focuses so much effort on producing more and more.\n\nRight now, Vietnam is producing a whopping <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25811724\">2 million tons annually</a> and the number is growing with each year.\n\nVietnamese people usually lead a laid-back lifestyle which means many coffee breaks. It\'s not a coincidence to see them on the street or coffee shops enjoying their coffee, no matter of the time.\n\n<strong>Expand your knowledge: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam\">Learn about Vietnamese culture!</a></strong>\n\nIt was a really funny experience when I saw many small chairs set up on the street with Vietnamese people sitting on them while enjoying their coffee. And yeah, it was night time already.\n\nThey have so many different options when it comes to coffee and it\'s really hard to choose. I rarely drank bad coffee there.\n\nI tried a regular drip coffee (iced and hot), coffee with condensed milk (their regular one), coconut coffee, yogurt coffee and strongest black coffee I\'ve ever had.\n\n<strong>Each one of these blew me away, but still, I really stick to drip coffee for various reasons:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>our host family has the equipment at home, so it\'s easy and convenient to brew it.</li>\n 	<li>the whole process takes around <strong>10 minutes</strong> (they really love to take your time on every action they do).</li>\n 	<li>it\'s tasty, strong and keeps you alert and awake!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How to Brew Vietnamese Drip Coffee At Home?</strong></h2>\nMaybe it sounds complicated as there is a whole process behind it, but believe me, once you get used to it, it just becomes a nice routine!\n\nSo, I will share with you the process of making a Vietnamese black coffee with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_milk\">condensed milk</a>. You could add ice or leave it black.\n\nAnyway, if you\'re a coffee addict, you will definitely fall in love with this coffee and the whole process of preparation.\n\n<em>Let\'s start!</em>\n<h3>1. Pick the right coffee beans and brand of coffee</h3>\nI\'m not sure about the coffee around the world, but in Vietnam, I\'m using <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Trung-Nguyen-Vietnamese-coffee-can/dp/B000F17AKC/?tag=calisequipzon-20\">Trung Nguyen coffee</a>. Many people tell amazing things about this coffee and I think it\'s not a coincidence that you can find a bag of these beans in every household.\n\nIf you\'re not in Vietnam, then my advice is to try to get that coffee brand online. <em>Don\'t worry if you can\'t get it as there are many alternatives:</em>\n<ul>\n 	<li>use any dark roast coffee</li>\n 	<li>medium coarse ground coffee will do just fine</li>\n 	<li>any Robusta brand will make the work</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1132\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_6278-e1541324921612-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Trung Nguyen coffee brand in Vietnam\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" /></h3>\n<h3>2. Make sure that you have the equipment (Phins)</h3>\nOnce you get your hands on the perfect coffee, it\'s time to find the right equipment that will help you in brewing the ideal coffee.\n\nIn Vietnam, it\'s called a <em>Phin</em> and it refers to a small metal cup, filter and lid. You put these three on the top of the cup and simply wait. You can literally see each drip dropping down in your cup while enjoying your time.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1133\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_6050-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Coffee phin and other equipment for Vietnamese coffee\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nIt\'s very easy to get Vietnamese coffee filter and I recommend you to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Vietnamese-Coffee-Filter-Gravity-Insert/dp/B01AK11S7C/?tag=calisequipzon-20\">check this one</a>!\n<h3><strong>3. Preparation process</strong></h3>\nOnce you have a coffee, Phin and filter, you\'re ready to brew your first Vietnamese coffee at home!\n\nIt will take around 10 minutes, but don\'t worry, Vietnamese love to do everything slowly. Just enjoy and relax a bit, it\'s good for your health!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1134\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_6054-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Phin filled with delicious coffee\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nFirst, fill the Phin with a desired amount of coffee. I usually put around 4 small spoons, but you can do even more.

One of the first things I noticed was the way Vietnamese respect their coffee breaks. Their culture is so strong as well as their coffee and they have so many different coffees to try! Such an amazing country if you love your coffee strong and diverse!\n\nOne of the easiest, but very tasty and strong coffee to prepare is a Vietnamese drip coffee. When you walk around the city, you can see people sitting on their tiny chairs and sipping their coffee. Almost every home has the equipment for making a tasty drip coffee.\n\nWhen I tried it the first time, I immediately got hooked and now I\'m the part of their coffee culture - drinking a few strong coffees per day, no matter the time.\n\nNo matter where you\'re in the world, you should get ingredients and equipment, so you could be always ready for one shot of Vietnamese coffee! Also, it\'s easy to get your hands on the filter and it\'s highly portable as dimensions are very small. It makes a coffee filter and coffee the portable and delicious <strong><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/souvenirs-from-vietnam\">Vietnamese souvenir</a></strong> you should bring home.\n<h2><strong>Vietnamese Coffee Culture Is So Strong!</strong></h2>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1131\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vietnamese-coffee-culutre-1024x668.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnamese drip coffee culture\" width=\"1024\" height=\"668\" />\n\nYou may ask why Vietnamese people have such a strong culture and variety when it comes to coffee.\n\nWell, if we look a bit in the history, it\'s not a strange thing why <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-coffee-culture\">Vietnamese culture is revolving around the coffee</a>. The country is the second producer of coffee in the world!\n\nAs the country was a French colony, it was brought to Vietnam <a href=\"https://vina.com/cafe/\">during the 19th century</a> and since then, the government focuses so much effort on producing more and more.\n\nRight now, Vietnam is producing a whopping <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25811724\">2 million tons annually</a> and the number is growing with each year.\n\nVietnamese people usually lead a laid-back lifestyle which means many coffee breaks. It\'s not a coincidence to see them on the street or coffee shops enjoying their coffee, no matter of the time.\n\n<strong>Expand your knowledge: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam\">Learn about Vietnamese culture!</a></strong>\n\nIt was a really funny experience when I saw many small chairs set up on the street with Vietnamese people sitting on them while enjoying their coffee. And yeah, it was night time already.\n\nThey have so many different options when it comes to coffee and it\'s really hard to choose. I rarely drank bad coffee there.\n\nI tried a regular drip coffee (iced and hot), coffee with condensed milk (their regular one), coconut coffee, yogurt coffee and strongest black coffee I\'ve ever had.\n\n<strong>Each one of these blew me away, but still, I really stick to drip coffee for various reasons:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>our host family has the equipment at home, so it\'s easy and convenient to brew it.</li>\n 	<li>the whole process takes around <strong>10 minutes</strong> (they really love to take your time on every action they do).</li>\n 	<li>it\'s tasty, strong and keeps you alert and awake!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How to Brew Vietnamese Drip Coffee At Home?</strong></h2>\nMaybe it sounds complicated as there is a whole process behind it, but believe me, once you get used to it, it just becomes a nice routine!\n\nSo, I will share with you the process of making a Vietnamese black coffee with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_milk\">condensed milk</a>. You could add ice or leave it black.\n\nAnyway, if you\'re a coffee addict, you will definitely fall in love with this coffee and the whole process of preparation.\n\n<em>Let\'s start!</em>\n<h3>1. Pick the right coffee beans and brand of coffee</h3>\nI\'m not sure about the coffee around the world, but in Vietnam, I\'m using <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Trung-Nguyen-Vietnamese-coffee-can/dp/B000F17AKC/?tag=calisequipzon-20\">Trung Nguyen coffee</a>. Many people tell amazing things about this coffee and I think it\'s not a coincidence that you can find a bag of these beans in every household.\n\nIf you\'re not in Vietnam, then my advice is to try to get that coffee brand online. <em>Don\'t worry if you can\'t get it as there are many alternatives:</em>\n<ul>\n 	<li>use any dark roast coffee</li>\n 	<li>medium coarse ground coffee will do just fine</li>\n 	<li>any Robusta brand will make the work</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1132\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_6278-e1541324921612-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Trung Nguyen coffee brand in Vietnam\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" /></h3>\n<h3>2. Make sure that you have the equipment (Phins)</h3>\nOnce you get your hands on the perfect coffee, it\'s time to find the right equipment that will help you in brewing the ideal coffee.\n\nIn Vietnam, it\'s called a <em>Phin</em> and it refers to a small metal cup, filter and lid. You put these three on the top of the cup and simply wait. You can literally see each drip dropping down in your cup while enjoying your time.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1133\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_6050-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Coffee phin and other equipment for Vietnamese coffee\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nIt\'s very easy to get Vietnamese coffee filter and I recommend you to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Vietnamese-Coffee-Filter-Gravity-Insert/dp/B01AK11S7C/?tag=calisequipzon-20\">check this one</a>!\n<h3><strong>3. Preparation process</strong></h3>\nOnce you have a coffee, Phin and filter, you\'re ready to brew your first Vietnamese coffee at home!\n\nIt will take around 10 minutes, but don\'t worry, Vietnamese love to do everything slowly. Just enjoy and relax a bit, it\'s good for your health!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1134\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_6054-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Phin filled with delicious coffee\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nFirst, fill the Phin with a desired amount of coffee. I usually put around 4 small spoons, but you can do even more. Vietnamese people usually fill more than half of the Phin!\n<p id=\"PJxWxmg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-752 aligncenter\" src=\"http://balkandigitalnomads.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ac72de50e132.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\nPut the Phin at the top of the glass/cup.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1135\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_6060-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Put the filter in the phin.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nOnce you put a desired amount of coffee inside a Phin, just put the filter on top.\n\n<em><strong>You\'re ready for the showtime now!</strong></em>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1136\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_6062-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Process of making Vietnamese traditional coffee\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nFill the Phin with boiled water, sit back and relax while every drop of tasty coffee is dropping down to your cup.

He started with digging into MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 first and learned tons by trial and error. Following that adventure, Mario built his first HTML site in 1999. He found development so exciting that he spent day and night learning QBasic and started working at the local PC game club. Mario got involved with several other things related to website administration (translating security bulletins, setting up simple sites, etc) and soon found the technology field was full of activities he really enjoyed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Corporate Lifestyle</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mario started studying programming including an intensive high-level course for C#, Java development, and software engineering, and eventually got a job in a corporate environment. He soon became a team lead there, managing all the planning and paperwork for their projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But he continued freelancing on the side. He grew his own network of technical experts through attending, volunteering at, and organizing conferences. He also ran a technical forum and regularly spoke at universities and enterprise companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Remote Working and Business Opportunity</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The combination of a high workload and a daily three-hour-long commute made Mario’s life difficult. Many of his friends were still studying, traveling or unemployed. The blissful and calm lives they lived seemed like a fairy tale to him. And even while both his managers and his clients were abroad, he was unable to obtain permission to work remotely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Mario decided to leave his job and start freelancing full time. But he found he faced a massive challenge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He discovered Java projects were pretty large and required an established team of people working together in an office. All job opportunities were on-site, and some even required relocation abroad. Certified Java programmers weren’t being hired on a remote basis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Mario had some PHP experience from previous jobs, he used this to start his freelance career. For his projects, he used both plain PHP and PHP frameworks like CakePHP and CodeIgniter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a while, Mario accepted work using commonly known platforms including Joomla, Drupal, and WordPress. In addition, he worked on PHP, Java, Python and some C# projects for a couple of years, after which he decided to switch to WordPress completely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Building products</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of his projects involved a technically challenging charity backed by several international organizations. Unexpected shortages in the team put him in the technical lead position. As a result, Mario found himself planning the next phases, meeting with the client regularly, and renegotiating the terms. The team completed the project successfully, and after the launch, a TV campaign led millions of visitors to the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result of the successful launch, this client invited Mario to participate in more WordPress projects, including building a custom framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“I wasn’t that acquainted with WordPress back then. For me, a conventional person trained in architectural design patterns and best practices, WordPress seemed like an eccentric young hipster somewhere on the line between insane and genius at the same time. I had to spend a couple of months learning WordPress from the inside out.”</em></p><cite>Mario Peshev</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As his interest in WordPress grew, Mario stopped delivering other custom platforms, and converted clients to WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>European Community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/04/20191001_144227-scaled.jpg?fit=632%2C356&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Mario presenting to an audience\" class=\"wp-image-8546\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/04/20191001_144227-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/04/20191001_144227-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/04/20191001_144227-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/04/20191001_144227-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/04/20191001_144227-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/04/20191001_144227-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/04/20191001_144227-scaled.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/04/20191001_144227-scaled.jpg?w=1896&amp;ssl=1 1896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" /><figcaption>Mario presenting at a WordCamp</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For Mario, one of the key selling points of WordPress was the international openness. He had previously been involved with other open source communities, some of which were US-focused. He felt they were more reliant on meeting people in person. With events only taking place in the US, this made building relationships much harder for people living in other countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the WordPress project started out in the US, the WordPress community quickly globalized. Dozens of WordCamps and hundreds of Meetup events take place around the globe every year.&nbsp; All of these events bring a wide variety of people sharing their enthusiasm for WordPress together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Mario, the birth of WordCamp Europe was something magical. The fact that hundreds, and later on thousands, of people from all over the world gathered around the topic of WordPress speaks for itself. Mario has been involved with organizing WordCamp Europe twice (in 2014 and 2015).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“There’s nothing like meeting WordPress enthusiasts and professionals from more than 50 countries brainstorming and working together at a WordCamp. You simply have to be there to understand how powerful it all is.”</em></p><cite>Mario Peshev</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Growing businesses and teams</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A key WordPress benefit is its popularity – an ever growing project currently powering <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress\">more than 35% of the Internet [2020].</a> It’s popular enough to be a de facto standard for websites, platforms, e-commerce and blogs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has a low barrier to entry. You can achieve a lot without being an expert, meaning most people can start gaining experience without having to spend years learning how to code. That also makes it easier to build businesses and teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“Being able to use a tool that is user-friendly, not overly complicated and easily extensible makes introducing it to team members faster and easier. It requires less time for adjustment, and as a result makes a team stronger and faster. The fact that this tool is cost-effective also allows more startups to enter the market. It requires&nbsp; less time and investments to launch an MVP. This boosts the entire ecosystem.”</em></p><cite>Mario Peshev</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Helping Others</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mario also introduced WordPress to children and young people. He taught them how to use WordPress as a tool for homework and class assignments. By using WordPress, they were able to learn the basics of designing themes, developing plugins, marketing statistics, social media, copywriting, and so much more. This approachable introduction to the software meant technical skills were not needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was also part of a team of volunteers who helped a group of young people living at a foster home struggling to provide for themselves. The team taught the basic digital literacy skills necessary in the modern workplace and potentially pay for their rent and basic needs. This included working with Microsoft Word, Excel and WordPress, as well as some basic design and marketing skills. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“When you look at that from another perspective, a platform that could save lives &#8211; literally &#8211; and change the world for better is worth contributing to, in any possible manner.”</em></p><cite>Mario Peshev</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Contributing to the WordPress community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From the core team to supporting and organizing WordCamps, Mario has long been an active contributor to the global WordPress project. He is passionate about the connections fostered by people who are involved in building both the WordPress software and the community around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“The WordPress community consists of people of all race and color, living all around the world, working as teachers, developers, bloggers, designers, business owners. Let’s work together to help each other.

The primary focus areas of this release included the block editor, privacy, accessibility, and developer improvements, with the full list of enhancements covered in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/03/03/wordpress-5-4-field-guide/\">the 5.4 field guide</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building WordPress Core?

Gutenberg 7.7 introduced block patterns &#8211; predefined block layouts that are ready to use and tweak. This is an important step towards Full Site Editing, which is currently targeted for inclusion in WordPress 5.6. As a first iteration, you can pick and insert patterns from the Block Patterns UI, which has been added as a sidebar plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 7.7 also includes a refresh of the Block UI, which better responds to the ways users interact with the editor. For more information on the User UI and Block Patterns, read <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2020/03/18/block-based-themes-meeting-notes/\">this summary of the most recent Block-Based Themes meeting</a>. Gutenberg 7.8, introduced on March 25, further enhanced this Block UI redesign. Both releases also included a suite of improvements, bug fixes, new APIs, documentation, and more!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building Gutenberg?

Following this guidance, and with COVID-19 declared a pandemic, WordPress community organizers reluctantly but responsibly <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/03/12/latest-updates-on-changes-to-wordcamps/\">postponed or canceled their upcoming WordCamps</a> and meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As community events are an important part of the WordPress open-source project, the Community team made suggestions for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/03/20/taking-charity-hackathons-online/\">taking charity hackathons online</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/03/24/community-events-in-the-time-of-covid-19/\">proposed interim adjustments</a> to existing community event guidelines, and provided <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/03/13/online-conference-organizer-training/\">training for online conference organizing</a> with Crowdcast. The team is currently working on building a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/virtual-events/\">Virtual Events Handbook</a> that will continue to support WordPress community organizers at this time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved with the WordPress Community team, host your own virtual WordPress event, or help improve the documentation for all of this?

This month, to help make tracking contributions to the WordPress project across multiple locations easier, there is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/03/19/associating-github-accounts-with-wordpress-org-profiles/\">a new option</a> to connect your GitHub account to your WordPress.org profile. This connection allows for more accurate acknowledgement and recognition of contributors. You can connect your GitHub account to your WordPress.org account by editing your WordPress.org profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information and instructions on how to connect your accounts, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/03/19/associating-github-accounts-with-wordpress-org-profiles/\">read the announcement post</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Modernizing WordPress coding standards</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Defined coding standards is an important step in creating the consistent codebase needed to prepare for requiring PHP 7.x for WordPress Core. As such, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/03/20/updating-the-coding-standards-for-modern-php/\">coding standards have been proposed</a> for implementation in WordPress Coding Standards 3.0.0. This includes new proposed standards for namespace declarations, import use statements, fully qualified names in inline code, traits and interfaces, type declarations, declare statements/strict typing, the ::class constant, operators, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved or view the full list of currently proposed new coding standards?

She had just finished high school and was awaiting her results for admission to university. She spent all of her time (10 hours a day) and all of her pocket money buying bulk time online at cafes. All the way through university that was true, until in 2008 she graduated with a degree in philosophy and bought her own computer and modem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She started blogging in 2009. Initially, she tried out Blogger, Hubpages, and WordPress—but found WordPress too complicated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Growing up as a timid but curious cat</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary is one of four kids, and the only girl among her siblings. Throughout her childhood she felt shy, even though others didn’t always see her that way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When she first started her personal blog, it was mostly an opportunity for her to speak her mind where she was comfortable. Blogging gave her a medium to express her thoughts and with every new post she became a better writer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rediscovering WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After completing a postgraduate diploma in mass communication, Mary started a Masters degree in Information Management. This required a three month internship. She decided to volunteer in Ghana in 2015 at the headquarters of the Salesians of Don Bosco in West Africa (SDBAFW<strong>)</strong> where her uncle was based.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While she was there, her uncle asked Mary why she was not blogging on WordPress, which also happened to be the software the organisation used. She explained how difficult and complicated it was so he shared a group of beginner-level tutorial videos with her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After two weeks of watching those videos, she started to realize she could have a full-time career doing this. So she immediately joined a number of online training groups so she could learn everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>I saw a lot of people earning an income from things I knew and did for the fun of it. I found myself asking why I had not turned my passion into a business.</em></p><cite>Mary Job</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Not long after that, she was contacted by a website editor who was impressed by her blog. With the information available online for WordPress, she was able to learn everything she needed to improve and redesign a site for what turned into her first client.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/my-home-office-in-2016.jpeg?w=632&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8412\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/my-home-office-in-2016.jpeg?w=512&amp;ssl=1 512w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/my-home-office-in-2016.jpeg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Mary&#8217;s home office in 2016</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>I visited the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/showcase/\">WordPress.org showcase</a> and was wowed with all the good things I could do with WordPress.</em></p><cite>Mary Job</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016 after a year of deep WordPress learning, she had fallen in love with the CMS and wanted to give back to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">WordPress open source project</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She volunteered to help the Community team. And when she moved to Lagos later that year, she discovered there was an active WordPress Meetup community. This started her journey toward becoming a WordPress Meetup Co-organizer and a Global Community Team Deputy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today the Nigerian WordPress community continues to grow, as has the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Lagos-WordPress-Meetup-Group\">Lagos WordPress Meetup</a> group. The first Nigerian WordCamp took place in Lagos in 2018 and a <a href=\"https://2020.lagos.wordcamp.org/\">2020 event is being planned</a>.

Break out those knee-high Santa socks that you love to wear during the holidays. Slide into your Rocket City Trash Pandas tee and pretend the baseball season is going to happen this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, you can wear a suit and tie when you&rsquo;re working from home. However, I invite you to ditch the fresh-pressed trousers for your comfy sweatpants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many of you into working from the home office. Depending on your situation, that might be the kitchen table, the loveseat in the living room, or a closet if your kids are irritating enough. The worst thing we can do is put too much pressure on ourselves to be the model of perfection in this setting. Do not let anyone tell you that you must put on the suit and tie in lieu of that comfortable pullover you&rsquo;ve had since college.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Balance that statement with some common sense. If you are meeting with the big boss over a Zoom video call, you will want to take your company culture into account. If your boss is expecting you to dress as if in the office, what he or she sees onscreen should reflect that expectation. The same may be true for client calls, depending on how you want to present your service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all other situations, your dress code is entirely up to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam Tschorn, deputy fashion editor for the Los Angeles Times, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2020-04-17/working-from-home-regular-work-wardrobe-dress-up\">argues that you should ditch the sweatpants</a> and &ldquo;dress like the adult you&rsquo;re getting paid to be&rdquo;:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>Please, can we all put away those sweatpants, ratty, gray, decades-old collegiate sweatshirts and obscure minor league baseball caps and start our workdays looking like we deserve the paychecks we&rsquo;re lucky enough to be earning while the world around us burns? Especially, for the love of all that&rsquo;s holy, if there&rsquo;s a group video conference involved?</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ARTschorn/status/1251139655447150593\">Twitter was not kind.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of us who have been doing this remote work thing for a few years and have come to love our loungewear. We are not going to let the rookies ruin it for the rest of us, a sentiment shared by a friend on Facebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am sitting in my basketball shorts and a sleeveless T-shirt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking off your shoes is a hard requirement when entering my home, a practical cleanliness tip I learned from time spent with Korean friends. It is the respectful thing to do. Plus, it is so much more relaxing. I want you to feel at home at my home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people have trouble balancing work and home life when they are merged into one space. In those cases, &ldquo;dressing for success&rdquo; may help you mentally push through the day. However, it is a personal choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one thing Tschorn and I agree on wholeheartedly is ritual. If even one thing about my daily ritual gets thrown off by unforeseen circumstances, I lose focus. It can often ruin the whole day.  Those little rituals are a part of what set me up for success. Everyone&rsquo;s are different. Some will want their morning coffee. Others need to shower, shave, and put on their Sunday best to feel like everything is right with the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are rare days when I feel the need to switch it up. Put on a nice suit. Grab my seldom-worn fedora and place it firmly atop my head. It makes me feel like a 1920s-esque reporter who is ready to dig up some dirt on the local crime boss. Those days are about making me feel good about myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, most days, it is about feeling comfortable at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It does not matter if you wear a Call of Duty T-shirt when building a new WooCommerce add-on plugin. Most people are not going to care if you don Sailor Moon sweatpants while running a successful managed WordPress hosting service. And, if you feel comfortable enough doing it, strip down to your undies while designing the next big WordPress theme. <em>You may want to add a top while video conferencing in that last case &mdash; there are limits.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Life is tough enough right now without fashion gurus telling us what to wear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even work-from-home veterans are <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/finding-balance-in-these-uncertain-times-remote-work-and-sharing-our-struggles\">off our game at the moment</a>. The world has changed practically overnight. We are still catching our breath from the gut-punch of this unique virus. We deserve to <em>let ourselves go</em> a bit while dealing with the stress of these changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do not know much about fashion. I still break out my cargo pants from time to time, which are apparently a fashion <em>faux pas</em> today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I do know a little something about is working comfortably from home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is all about what makes you feel good about yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am probably preaching to the choir of remote developers, designers, and team managers. Many of us have been down this road and found that sweet spot that helps us get through the day. For the newcomers, welcome to our world. Kick your heels off at the door. There is no fashion-shaming here.  Enjoy our guilt-free software and community in your lazy pants.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 19:18:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"WPTavern: Frontity Raises €1M with Automattic and K Fund\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=98846\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:157:\"https://wptavern.com/frontity-raises-e1m-with-automattic-and-k-fund?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=frontity-raises-e1m-with-automattic-and-k-fund\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4732:\"<p><a href=\"https://frontity.org/\">Frontity</a>, a free, open source framework for building WordPress themes with React, has raised &euro;1M in funding in a round led by <a href=\"https://kfund.co\">K Fund</a>, with <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> covering 22%. The team behind the framework officially made it open source in May 2019, after battle testing it internally. In one year the framework has more than 12,700 npm downloads and has built a community of 250 developers who use it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frontity lowers the barrier to creating fast-loading, React-powered WordPress themes by removing the hassle of setting up and configuring all the tooling. The framework seems to have captured Automattic&rsquo;s interest as a homegrown WordPress solution for facilitating decoupled setups that use React on the frontend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We decided to build the framework as a response to the demand of all the big publishers we were working with,&rdquo; Frontity CEO Pablo Postigo said. &ldquo;This trend can drastically change the way many WordPress websites are built in the future. From my point of view, Automattic&rsquo;s support means that they are also aware of this trend, and want to be close to us. In the end we are trying to make WordPress keep up with the latest technologies, and the stronger WordPress is, the better for all the companies that depend on it, including Automattic.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frontity is not yet profitable and Postigo said the company is not developing a business model during this initial phase. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This funding round was the best way for us to make the project sustainable,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Possible monetizations that we are thinking of to generate revenue in the future are a hosting solution, premium support, or a marketplace of paid themes.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frontity&rsquo;s Biggest Challenge: Becoming a Compelling Alternative to PHP Themes  </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Postigo identified Gatsby and Next.js as Frontity&rsquo;s chief competitors in the sea of React frameworks vying for developers&rsquo; attention. He said his team takes inspiration from these frameworks and appreciates how they are raising awareness of new ways of building websites.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our biggest challenge right now is to position Frontity not as an alternative to other frameworks, but as an alternative to PHP themes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So when developers start looking for the best way to build a superior UX they consider Frontity amongst their options.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who are already familiar with other JS frameworks like Gatsby will find that Frontity has fewer new concepts to learn, since it is 100% focused on WordPress and its APIs. Postigo identified a few other major differences between Frontity and other popular JS frameworks:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It&rsquo;s rendered dynamically: this means people don&rsquo;t have to rebuild the HTML each time they edit or publish content. Frontity&rsquo;s preferred approach is <a href=\"https://vercel.com/blog/serverless-pre-rendering\">Serverless Pre-Rendering</a>, although there are many ways to configure it. It&rsquo;s as fast as a static site (e.g. <a href=\"https://mars.frontity.org\">https://mars.frontity.org</a>).</li><li>It&rsquo;s opinionated: it has its own state manager and uses Emotion for the CSS. Thanks to that people don&rsquo;t need to learn things like Redux and, at the same time, it powers a very flexible extensibility pattern, more similar to the one of WordPress itself than to the rest of JS frameworks. Themes and extensions can be activated and deactivated without code changes.</li><li>There&rsquo;s no need to learn GraphQL or the REST API, you get the data using the state manager.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with fewer new concepts to learn, Frontity remains squarely within the developers&rsquo; toolbox and is not currently a product that would appeal to non-technical users. Expanding Frontity&rsquo;s user base beyond developers and breaking into the wider WordPress market is a long-term goal for the company. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;With Frontity Framework we are on a mission to help developers build performant, scalable websites with WordPress and React easily,&rdquo; Postigo said. &ldquo;But the company&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to make building delightful user experiences universally accessible.<br /><br />&ldquo;We have plans to lower the technical barrier so any WordPress user can benefit from our technology.

It is essentially an online builder that allows users to craft a full page layout by mixing and matching various sections. They can then copy the resulting output at the click of a button and paste it into the editor on their sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I intend to speed up the workflow for WordPress users to spin up beautiful Gutenberg pages, even full websites, faster,&rdquo; said Munir Kamal, founder of Gutenberg Hub. &ldquo;So all I am trying to do is headed in that direction.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kamal has also released a <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gutenberghub/pkjhekakadbpmpehgkdndgmpepphekbk\">Chrome browser extension</a> that allows end-users to add templates from the growing library of options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The idea is to help DIYers, freelancers, or anyone with creating new website pages faster,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have many feature ideas to make this builder great, but I want to hear out the feedback and suggestions from the community about it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, Kamal is calling this version of the builder a &ldquo;prototype&rdquo; because he wants to validate the idea with the community before moving forward with new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Using the Template Builder</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Building a template or full page is simple. Users merely need to visit the template builder page. On the page, the builder has an &ldquo;Add Section&rdquo; button, which will slide the template library panel open. From that point, users can choose from an extensive list of templates that includes designs for hero sections, testimonials, sliders, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Gutenberg Hub&rsquo;s templates library.\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is to build a full page by combining multiple sections. Users will want to add new sections and organize them for their needs. Each section can be trashed, duplicated, or moved up/down using the available buttons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trying my hand at building a simple product page, I was able to pick and choose the sections I wanted to add in just a few minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom combination of templates with the builder.\n\n\n\n<p>Once everything is in place, users can copy the full template code and paste it their block editor.  From that point, they can edit it on their own site.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, it may be necessary to copy additional CSS and insert it via the WordPress customizer or through a plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/blocks-css/\">Blocks CSS</a>.  Some options also require users to install a plugin to use specific blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the type of power I want in the hands of WordPress users. Plug-and-play template systems like this will push the platform into the future. However, such systems need to be integrated directly into WordPress. Copying and pasting from a third-party website is merely a stepping stone toward that future, catering to user needs in the here and now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Future of the Builder and More</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Long term, Gutenberg Hub&rsquo;s work may be a better fit into the upcoming <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/block-patterns-will-change-everything\">pattern system</a>. The team could release a plugin that would integrate seamlessly into the block editor. That way, end-users could build their templates without ever leaving the comfort of the post-editing screen, or at least avoid switching between browser tabs. However, patterns are still months away from inclusion in core WordPress. In the meantime, this feels like a solid stop-gap. Plus, the team can build a nice library and garner feedback and data from users on the most popular templates/patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Kamal wants to hear feedback before moving forward, he does have some big ideas of his own for the builder. &ldquo;For example, this builder may let you create projects, and under projects, you may create multiple pages,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For each project, you may define custom branding (typography, color scheme, etc.), and all the templates from the library will adapt to that branding when you create pages under a specific project.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important thing he wants to accomplish is to build tools that speed up workflows for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He will also open the template library to third-party developers and designers soon. There will be a public submission process. If enough people contribute, the library could balloon to an untold number of options that would be directly available as part of the builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Besides the templates and builder, I am planning something around the Gutenberg Templates API,&rdquo; said Kamal. He stresses that it is still in the planning phase. If the previous work that he has put out is any indication, this could be an interesting project. He is also working on a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/forms-gutenberg/\">form builder plugin</a> for the block editor, which is currently seeing regular updates.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 20:03:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"WPTavern: Google Shopping Is Now Open to Free Product Listings\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=98848\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:169:\"https://wptavern.com/google-shopping-is-now-open-to-free-product-listings?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=google-shopping-is-now-open-to-free-product-listings\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2768:\"<p>Google <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/shopping/its-now-free-to-sell-on-google/\">announced</a> today that it is bringing free listings to the Shopping tab in the United States before the end of April and will expand globally by the end of the year. Previously, merchants were required to pay for ad placement and product listings, which led to major online retailers dominating the Shopping tab.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Beginning next week, search results on the Google Shopping tab will consist primarily of free listings, helping merchants better connect with consumers, regardless of whether they advertise on Google,&rdquo; Bill Ready, Google&rsquo;s president of commerce, said. &ldquo;With hundreds of millions of shopping searches on Google each day, we know that many retailers have the items people need in stock and ready to ship, but are less discoverable online.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This change comes at a critical time when the retail industry has taken a significant hit due to shelter-in-place orders aimed at mitigating the spread of the coronavirus. Free listings make showing up in the Google Shopping tab more accessible for independent stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;For retailers, this change means free exposure to millions of people who come to Google every day for their shopping needs,&rdquo; Ready said. &ldquo;For shoppers, it means more products from more stores, discoverable through the Google Shopping tab.&rdquo;&nbsp; Existing Merchant Center users will retain their ads for specific products as promoted listings but will also now be able to list their full inventories for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google also announced a new partnership with PayPal that will streamline the onboarding process for merchants who want to link their accounts. The announcement identified WooCommerce, Shopify, and BigCommerce as existing partners that offer platforms to help businesses sell online. In light of the current crisis, WooCommerce has ramped up its efforts to make e-commerce more approachable. The team recently hosted a free webinar on <a href=\"https://zoom.us/webinar/register/8615868833115/WN_4TTi3KPWQZG5HCchf81LEg\">how to start selling online</a> and produced a <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/add-online-store-to-wordpress/\">guide to adding a store to an existing WordPress website</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Google cites the coronavirus pandemic as a factor in advancing the company&rsquo;s plans to make it free for merchants to sell on Google, the move is a strategic step towards wooing back the overwhelming amount of traffic it sends to Amazon. If Google&rsquo;s Shopping tab can become a better source for price comparisons with a diversity of stores, consumers may return to searching Google first when intending to make a purchase.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 02:46:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 5.2.0 Maintenance and Security Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=311121\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://buddypress.org/2020/04/buddypress-5-2-0-maintenance-and-security-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1666:\"<p><a href=\"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/buddypress.5.2.0.zip\">BuddyPress 5.2.0</a> is now available.

After the block editor adopted the approach of using SVG icons directly, WordPress design contributors have recently reevaluated the efforts going into the Dashicons project. The team decided to wrap up existing tickets for new icons, push out a final release, and then pool their efforts on the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/master/packages/components/src/icon\">new Icon component</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;One of the challenges with an icon font is that it&rsquo;s one big compiled &lsquo;sprite,&rsquo; and so even though it gets cached well, for every icon you add the sprite grows bigger,&rdquo; WordPress design contributor Joen Asmussen said in a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2020/04/20/next-steps-for-dashicons/\">post</a> announcing the change. &ldquo;With SVG you include just the icons you need.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A recently-merged <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/dashicons/pull/411\">pull request</a> brings the project&rsquo;s collection of 303 icons to a total of 340, with final additions including items like airplane, beer, coffee, and more, based on the remaining open issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With just a handful of contributors, Dashicons had been subject to infrequent updates. Prior to WordPress 5.2 (May 2019), which <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-2-will-add-13-new-icons-to-the-dashicon-library\">updated</a> the icon font to use WOFF2 (Web Open Font Format 2) and added 13 new icons, Dashicons had gone dormant for three years. This means that developers who needed a specific icon were sometimes waiting a long time for it to get added and often opted to use a different library. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Icon component isn&rsquo;t subject to the same limitations. During the design team&rsquo;s recent discussion about Dashicon&rsquo;s next steps, Asmussen noted that the new Icon component comes with a set of icons but developers can also feed it a custom SVG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;An icon doesn&rsquo;t have to be part of the set for it to be treated like any other icons in the system,&rdquo; Asmussen said. &ldquo;Which makes it easier to say no to some social icons &mdash; we can say &lsquo;No, but you can do this: {code example}.\'&rdquo; This flexibility prevents developers from having to spend time lobbying for a particular icon to get added or working to demonstrate its popularity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asmussen thanked Dashicons creator Ben Dunkle for his work in maintaining the icon font over the years. Dunkle will join the effort to improve the new Icon component as it is still being fleshed out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;And a lot of the lessons Ben and I learned from Dashicons could probably help spell out some principles for what fits in the component,&rdquo; Asmussen said. &ldquo;In some ways, I think we can be much more open to accepting icons because it doesn&rsquo;t balloon a sprite. In others, as mentioned, we can decide it&rsquo;s not WordPress&rsquo; place.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dashicons will be maintained in core indefinitely but no new icons will be added after this point. Plugin developers have the option to continue using the icon font or embrace the new Icon component. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Switching to SVG in WP-admin, and perhaps the new Icon component, is a discussion definitely worth having at some point,&rdquo; Asmussen said. &ldquo;But [it&rsquo;s] worth noting that it&rsquo;s not necessarily part of today&rsquo;s discussion. This is first and foremost to ensure Dashicons is in a solid place for everyone relying on it.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 01:16:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"WPTavern: WPBlockTalk Videos Now Available on WordPress.tv\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=98727\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:161:\"https://wptavern.com/wpblocktalk-videos-now-available-on-wordpress-tv?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wpblocktalk-videos-now-available-on-wordpress-tv\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2497:\"<p>All of the recordings from the free <a href=\"https://wpblocktalk.wordpress.stream/\">WPBlockTalk</a> virtual event are <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/event/wpblocktalk-april-2020/\">now available on WordPress.tv</a>.

It included an overview of what is coming in the full-site editing project, along with an exciting hands-on demo that fully integrates theme templates into a unified interface. Ventura estimates this basic UI will be &ldquo;in a very decent state in a couple months.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The other 11 sessions that follow provide an interesting look at where the block editor has been and where we can expect it to go in the near future. Topics include extensibility, case studies, accessibility, block development, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although WPBlockTalk was originally <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2020/03/18/wpblocktalk-block-editor-event/\">announced</a> on the WordPress.com News blog, the majority of the content featured in the event was geared towards those creating block-based products. More than 1,000 viewers attended WPBlockTalk, similar to the turnout for a large traditional WordCamp. These types of nimble, niche-focused virtual events were already gaining traction in 2019 and are likely to become more common in the wake of prolonged restrictions on large gatherings due to the coronavirus. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 22:47:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: On Digital Gardens, Blogs, Personal Spaces, and the Future\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=98695\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:175:\"https://wptavern.com/on-digital-gardens-blogs-personal-spaces-and-the-future?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=on-digital-gardens-blogs-personal-spaces-and-the-future\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8960:\"<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull has-background-dim-70 has-gray-900-background-color has-background-dim has-parallax bg-gray-900\"><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap has-text-align-left has-extra-large-font-size text-xl text-left\">Ihave been thinking a lot about digital gardens this week. A blog post by Tom McFarlin <a href=\"https://tommcfarlin.com/digital-gardens-and-blogs/\">re-introduced me to the term</a>, which led me down a rabbit hole of interesting ideas on creating a digital space that is more personalized and tended in a way that is antithetical to the chronological blog.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept of digital gardens is not new. It predates the modern blog, but there may be a resurgence, albeit small, of the sort of curated content that grows within a digital garden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The term &ldquo;digital garden&rdquo; is not well-defined. In general, it is a collection of thoughts, unfinished projects, links, and much more. However, it can be different and wholly unique to the individual. I would like to broaden the term to enclose any sort of website that allows you to truly browse without viewing posts chronologically. Digital gardens, collections, spaces &mdash; call it what you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I began my personal website in 2003. I hacked together a main page with a few internal links. I began blogging before I knew what blogging was. This was all done with basic <code>.txt</code> files that I edited in Notepad on Windows. I knew enough PHP to load and display those files. My <em>blog</em> posts were merely random thoughts &mdash; bits and pieces of my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite having something that worked sort of like a blog, I maintained various resources and links of other neat ideas I found around the web. It was a digital garden that I tended, occasionally plucking weeds and planting new ideas that may someday blossom into something more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I created a films page in which I shared 30-second trailers of short films I was planning. I maintained a list of my DVD collection. I had a page in which I showcased hate messages I received on my guestbook. <em>All in good fun, of course.</em> I kept a curated list of cool webpages to visit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this was a painstaking, manual process before WordPress crashed into my life, but it was still fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, WordPress changed everything for me. I officially became a blogger. The problem was that, at a certain point, blogging became <em>work</em>. I needed to think about keywords, perfecting a post title, and making sure that each word was carefully crafted. The initial joy I had with my personal space had waned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The idea of a &lsquo;blog&rsquo; needs to get over itself,&rdquo; wrote Joel Hooks in a post titled <a href=\"https://joelhooks.com/on-writing-more\">Stop Giving af and Start Writing More</a>. &ldquo;Everybody is treating writing as a &lsquo;content marketing strategy&rsquo; and using it to &lsquo;build a personal brand&rsquo; which leads to the fundamental flawed idea that everything you post has to be polished to perfection and ready to be consumed.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is almost as if he had reached down into my soul and figured out why I no longer had the vigor I once had for sharing on my personal blog. For far too long, I was trying to brand myself. Posts became few and far between. I still shared a short note, aside, once in a while, but much of what I shared was for others rather than myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still love the idea of a personal blog, but there is room for this space to be reshaped. Personal websites can be so much more than a progression of posts over time, newer posts showing up while everything from the past is neatly tucked on &ldquo;page 2&rdquo; and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amy Hoy, in <a href=\"https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/\">How the Blog Broke the Web</a>, describes the downfall of the digital gardens that once grew across the landscape of the web. It is a history of how personal websites, particularly through the ease of use of the modern CMS, changed for the worse. Instead of carefully tending to our gardens, we became lazy caretakers of our space, molding our content based on the tools the system provided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She concluded with:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There are no more quirky homepages.  There are no more amateur research librarians. All thanks to a quirky bit of software produced to alleviate the pain of a tiny subset of a very small audience. That&rsquo;s not cool at all.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>She shares my <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/rebirth-of-creativity-gutenberg-and-the-future-of-wordpress-themes\">nostalgia for the early web</a> in which webmasters poured everything about themselves into their little slice of it. It was done over the sweat and tears of late-night HTML mastery. It was about fighting weird CSS quirks just to align something on the center of the page. <em>No grid or flex-box existed in those days.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I lament the loss of some of the artistry of the early web and lay much of the blame at the feet of blogging platforms like WordPress, such platforms also opened the web to far more people who would not have otherwise been able to create a website. <em>Democratizing publishing</em> is a far loftier goal than dropping animated GIFs across personal spaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is in a position to reshape the web into whatever we want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the platform&rsquo;s history, end-users have remained at the mercy of their WordPress theme. Most themes are built around what WordPress allows out of the box. They follow a similar formula. Some may have a fancy homepage or other custom page templates. But, on the whole, themes have been primarily built around the idea of a blog. Such themes do not give the user true control over where to place things on their website. While some developers have attempted solutions to this, most have never met the towering goal of putting the power of HTML and CSS into the hands of users through a visual interface. This lack of tools has given rise to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/will-page-builders-remain-competitive-in-the-block-era\">page builders and the block editor</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has not been, by and large, an ideal platform for building a unique digital space, unless you had the technical know-how to wrangle its front-end output into something unique. At times, that is more frustrating than building a simple HTML page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the reason that I continually push the Gutenberg project. I write about some of the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-wacky-world-of-sorta-brilliants-sorta-fun-block-plugins\">wild and wacky ideas</a>. I share things like a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/block-a-saurus-embeds-a-side-scrolling-t-rex-game-via-the-block-editor\">T-Rex game</a> within a block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want end-users to be able to create their own digital gardens. I want them to put a large yellow box on their homepage to share a notice that everyone should read &ldquo;this important page&rdquo; on their site. I want them to be able to do this without having to learn how to code or ask their theme author how to make such customizations. It should be as simple as clicking a few buttons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also want them to be able to easily build something like Tom Critchlow&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/\">wikifolder</a>, a digital collection of links, random thoughts, and other resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than anything, I want personal websites to be more <em>personal</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re still in a somewhat frustrating transitional period where WordPress is not even halfway to becoming the platform that it will be. We are still beholden to our themes, though less so than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it is a digital garden, a plain ol&rsquo; blog, or some new thing we do not have a term for yet, we will all be able to put our unique spin on our personal spaces. It is part of the web that we lost in the last couple of decades with the emergence of the CMS. However, WordPress is on the right path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may be a rough ride for some agencies and businesses around the platform, but I am OK with that. They will manage and pull through on the other side, mostly unscathed. I am more concerned about our mission statement of democratizing publishing. And, that mission is not simply about having the ability to write content via a <em>$free</em> system. It is about the freedom to create whatever types of digital homes that we desire without learning to code or breaking the bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pre-Gutenberg WordPress got us part of the way there. It is the post-Gutenberg world that will get us the rest of the way. I am ready to see what people create when they gain the freedom that particular world promises.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 20:00:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: Leave at Door: New Free WooCommerce Plugin Enables Contact-free Delivery\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=98679\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:207:\"https://wptavern.com/leave-at-door-new-free-woocommerce-plugin-enables-contact-free-delivery?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=leave-at-door-new-free-woocommerce-plugin-enables-contact-free-delivery\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3199:\"<p class=\"is-style-default\">As many countries around the world are currently in some form of lockdown to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, the hospitality industry has been one of the hardest hit by the new restrictions. Restaurants and breweries in particular have had to radically change how they do business and either lay off or furlough the majority of their employees. Many of those that have survived the mandated dine-in closures are jump-starting delivery services in order to stay afloat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott DeLuzio, a WordPress plugin developer and founder of <a href=\"https://amplifyplugins.com/\">Amplify Plugins</a>, recently noticed a &ldquo;leave at door&rdquo; option when ordering food from a local restaurant. He thought it would be a helpful option for WooCommerce store owners to add and created a plugin that makes it easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/leave-at-door-for-woocommerce/\">Leave at Door</a> is now available for free from the official WordPress Plugin Directory. It enables customers to maintain social distancing while receiving deliveries. The plugin adds a checkbox before the Place Order button at checkout, which reveals an optional text input for additional delivery instructions. If the customer chooses contact-free delivery, store owners will see it displayed on the admin order edit screen and in the order email. It will also be displayed on the customer&rsquo;s order invoice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeLuzio&rsquo;s Amplify Plugins shop focuses on plugins that improve the customer experience in WooCommerce. He reported that his products have seen more activity since social distancing  recommendations were put in place. With the pandemic slowing down shipments from Amazon and other major retailers, local and independent stores have an opportunity to gain the confidence of new customers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I have definitely seen an uptick in plugin sales over the last month or so,&rdquo; DeLuzio said. &ldquo;I think, through talking to a few customers, this can probably be attributed to traditional brick and mortar stores and restaurants that are looking to move online to compensate for the lack of foot traffic that they are getting in their stores.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The availability of contact-free delivery may be the deciding factor for some customers in quarantine, which could make all the difference for small business owners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> &ldquo;There are probably a good number of local businesses that are struggling these days,&rdquo; DeLuzio said. &ldquo;Their customers are probably very concerned with the virus and maintaining social distancing, so if something like this plugin can help them out, even in a small way, I&rsquo;m happy to have been able to put it together for them.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when some economies begin opening up, there will undoubtedly be customers who will still be keen on having a contact-free delivery option, especially those among the populations most vulnerable to COVID-19. The notion of contact-free delivery may have a longer run beyond this current crisis and perhaps even become a permanent fixture on e-commerce checkout screens. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 21:00:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: GitHub Opens Free Plan to Unlimited Collaborators on Private Repositories\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=98641\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:211:\"https://wptavern.com/github-opens-free-plan-to-unlimited-collaborators-on-private-repositories?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=github-opens-free-plan-to-unlimited-collaborators-on-private-repositories\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4411:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">On Tuesday, GitHub <a href=\"https://github.blog/2020-04-14-github-is-now-free-for-teams/\">announced a change to its plans</a> that would make collaboration between developers much cheaper. Free, in fact. Anyone can launch an organization for at no charge with unlimited public and private repositories. The change also includes an unlimited number of collaborators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will be good news for small WordPress development teams without the cashflow to upgrade to the paid Team pricing tier or higher. I have worked with several small plugin and theme businesses who could not foot the per-user billing and sought other solutions such as GitLab and Bitbucket. This move should make GitHub more enticing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/faq-about-changes-to-githubs-plans#how-long-will-github-free-allow-unlimited-collaborators\">FAQs page</a>, this pricing change is a permanent one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Until now, if your organization wanted to use GitHub for private development, you had to subscribe to one of our paid plans,&rdquo; wrote Nat Friedman, CEO of GitHub, in the announcement. &ldquo;But every developer on earth should have access to GitHub. Price shouldn&rsquo;t be a barrier.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />GitHub&rsquo;s lowest pricing tiers.\n\n\n\n<p>The Free pricing tier now offers:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Unlimited public and private repositories.</li><li>Unlimited collaborators.</li><li>2,000 Actions minutes/month.</li><li>500MB of GitHub Packages storage.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For a full overview of all changes, GitHub has created a <a href=\"https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/faq-about-changes-to-githubs-plans#what-plans-and-pricing-changes-did-github-announce-on-april-14\">question-and-answer section</a> in its FAQs that covers each detail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This means teams can now manage their work together in one place: CI/CD, project management, code review, packages, and more,&rdquo; said Friedman. &ldquo;We want everyone to be able to ship great software on the platform developers love.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The paid Team plan still exists. Like the Free plan, it is cheaper for a team of developers. GitHub reduced the pricing from $9/month for each user to $4/month. The plan also includes 3,000 GitHub Actions minutes each month, which will go into effect on May 14.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GitHub seems to be moving away from its previous pay-for-private model.  Instead, they have focused more on pricing based on features.  In January 2019, several months after Microsoft acquired GitHub, the company announced <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/github-announces-free-unlimited-private-repositories\">unlimited free private repositories</a>. However, only three collaborators were allowed on a project before being required to upgrade to a pro plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GitHub has essentially cornered the market on open-source in which most code is maintained in public repositories. With the recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/github-acquires-npm-plans-to-improve-infrastructure-and-experience\">acquisition of npm</a>, it will only grow stronger in this space. This pricing change should make it far more competitive for hosting private projects. The free tier puts the company on par with GitLab&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/\">free level</a>.  Bitbucket is now looking a little more costly. It would not be surprising if the site removed its five-collaborator limit on its <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/product/pricing\">free plan</a> if it sees a dip in usage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, this will be a good thing for commercial WordPress theme and plugin authors. From several companies I have knowledge of or have worked with, many of them have kept their public repositories on GitHub. However, they would use a different site for private repositories. It was a pain they had to deal with to cut costs. With no limits on the number of collaborators, GitHub&rsquo;s free plan may mean that some can move all of their repositories to a single home. Even if they wanted to upgrade to the Team plan for access to more tools, the reduced cost may be worth it if they prefer working with GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest change is there is no initial cost barrier for teams that are kicking off a private project with no funding on hand.

Not to fret, the team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/04/15/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15-april/\">dropped version 7.9 of the plugin</a> earlier today. This release includes several goodies such as new typography-related controls for blocks, extra patterns for testing, and even more work toward a lighter DOM for theme authors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the added time, version 7.9 is a larger release than usual. It includes over two dozen bug fixes and almost as many minor enhancements. The team continued work on full-site editing, which has moved along at a steady pace and is currently slated to land in WordPress 5.6 later this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The development team has made several tweaks to the user interface. This is a continuation of the work that has landed in the previous couple of major releases. WordPress users who are not running the Gutenberg plugin can expect to see the refreshed UI in August this year when WordPress 5.5 drops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One nice change is to the link inserter. Instead of outputting the URL from an existing post, it will output the post title instead. This should make it far quicker for users to insert links to their posts or pages in the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fullscreen mode can now be toggled on and off via the <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Shift</code> + <code>Alt</code> + <code>F</code> keyboard shortcut. That is assuming you consider remembering which four keys to press a <em>shortcut</em>. At least the option exists for those who need it. I suppose I will acquire the muscle memory to toggle it over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, this a major release in every sense. Everything from documentation to code quality has seen improvements. Developers can enjoy new APIs. Theme authors should also have an easier time styling buttons &mdash; the editor HTML should now be consistent with front-end output.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gradient All the Things</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom gradient background for the Media &amp; Text block.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Until now, users could add gradient backgrounds to the cover and button blocks. Gutenberg 7.9 extends this option to the group, columns, and media &amp; text blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have yet to see many theme authors take advantage of gradients. Granted, gradient backgrounds only landed in WordPress 5.4. I am hoping some of the top designers in the theme space can tackle this, if for no other reason than providing me some new eye candy when writing posts such as this that discuss gradients in Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, the addition of the gradients option to new blocks is a good thing. The next step is to continue expanding it to other blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Typography for Headings and Paragraphs</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Adjusting the font size of a heading block.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The Gutenberg team has finally checked off one of my longstanding pet peeves. The heading block now has a font-size option. Instead of users using an H1-level heading to make their text larger, they can stick with an appropriate-level heading for the document structure while using the font-size option to adjust how large it appears.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am concerned about the addition of a new setting to allow users to adjust the line-height for paragraphs and headings. Currently, the setting does not allow theme authors to add choices based on their design system or disable the feature altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get some new inline styles instead of classes. At this point, that ship has already sailed and sunk with Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The usefulness of a line-height setting is clear when designing a full-page layout, such as a single-page brochure. However, changing the line-height for most text on a site could have dire consequences in the long term, especially when an end-user switches themes and finds that their chosen line-height is completely out of sync with their new theme. I would not wish the pain of updating dozens or more old blog posts to adjust paragraph design on anyone. Of course, the same could be said of font sizes and similar settings. This is the one setting that I want to see with more theme author feedback as part of the decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Three New Block Patterns</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting the Numbered Features block pattern into the editor.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Gutenberg 7.9 removed the block patterns icon from the top right and tucked it behind the editor options menu. Users can pin the patterns sidebar, which will move the patterns icon back to the top for quick access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The update also introduces three additional block patterns, bringing the total to six.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Hero Two Columns:</strong> Displays a group that encloses an italic paragraph, a heading, and two columns of text.</li><li><strong>Numbered Features:</strong> Displays several groups of columns with a number on the left and text on the right.</li><li><strong>It&rsquo;s Time:</strong> Outputs a paragraph, two columns, and a large paragraph that reads &ldquo;it&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Numbered Features pattern is by far the most intricate pattern the Gutenberg team has put together while building the block patterns system. It is nice to see them exploring some designs that users will find useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, most of the patterns are relatively boring and not representative of how feature-rich this system will become in the future. It is important to remember that patterns are still at an early stage of development. By the time the feature lands in core WordPress, we should see more advanced and beautiful patterns for use on websites.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 20:14:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"HeroPress: Helping Small Businesses During A Pandemic\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=3109\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:158:\"https://heropress.com/essays/helping-small-businesses-during-a-pandemic/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=helping-small-businesses-during-a-pandemic\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11544:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/041320-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"WordPress is a powerful tool that can quickly be levereged to help people in need.\" /><p>In mid March 2020 it was clear that the coronvirus pandemic was going to have drastic consequences for daily life. Many local shops, market stalls and other food outlets would struggle to keep in touch with their regular customers. It was also worrying that lots of people would be stuck at home with only the internet and phone as ways to keep in touch with their local shops.</p>\n<h3>Getting Started</h3>\n<p>I decided to create a small site for local shops (and other related businesses) to put their contact info on so that people could get in touch. I bought the domain name <a href=\"https://www.cambridgelocalshops.co.uk\">www.cambridgelocalshops.co.uk</a> and got started. I decided to have several main sections &#8211; shops, food outlets, local support, delivery companies and activities.</p>\n<p>I add most shops that request to be added &#8211; small national brand supermarkets as well as independent shops. The only shops I&#8217;ve decided not to include are ones that could be misconstrued as giving medical advice.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This whole site is required because of a medical emergency and clear messaging on that topic is vital.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Some pubs and restaurants have started doing take-away food from their kitchens, and in addition offer a grocery ordering service. It&#8217;s a great way to keep their business open and offer really useful support to their community. Watching businesses change how they operate to help their communities is inspiring. I&#8217;ve heard that many neighbourhood &#8216;mutual aid groups&#8217; have found the site a useful way to get information about shops out to people who are isolated at home.</p>\n<h3>Spreading The Word</h3>\n<p>I shared the site on twitter and various other local groups I&#8217;m a member of. The number of hits I was getting on the site daily showed there was a need. The local <a href=\"https://www.em.admin.cam.ac.uk/what-we-do/estate-operations/facilities-services/reprographics\">university printing office</a>, just before closing for lockdown, ran off 10,000 leaflets about the site. The local <a href=\"https://www.zedify.co.uk/cambridge\">bike courier company</a> delivered them door to door free of charge. For them it was a way of supporting local businesses and shops that are their key customers in more normal times, and providing an important community service right now. The photos are all from <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/\">unsplash.com</a> &#8211; free of charge and great quality.  Jo at <a href=\"https://www.kabocreative.com/\">Kabocreative</a> designed the great logo and shared it with me.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Having designed the site in a morning using TwentySeventeen as the theme and using <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/atomic-blocks/\">Atomic Profile Blocks</a> for the individual shops I realised I needed something a bit more streamlined.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Juggling this clunky way of editing a site alongside home schooling two children and facing the challenges of life under lockdown was not viable. I started redeveloping the site behind the scenes, using posts instead of pages for each shop, categorising them according to type of shop and their location, and then building a site structure out of that categorising system. I also switched to <a href=\"https://generatepress.com/\">GeneratePress</a> for the theme (I love it). It all kind of worked.</p>\n<h3>Reaching Out</h3>\n<p>Then I got in touch with Topher DeRosia asking if he&#8217;d like me to write this up for his wonderful HeroPress blog aimed at the WordPress community. Many towns and districts around the world could do with a site like this and it&#8217;s a perfect way for a WordPress person to support their local shops and neighbours at this time.</p>\n<p>Topher did way more than that, coming on board to take a look at the back end of the site, make some brilliant changes and also contacting <a href=\"https://wsform.com/\">WSForm</a> for a pro plugin to help with the process.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Now, when someone completes the form to request an entry on the site it automatically creates a post with that shops&#8217; details already pre drafted.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I just need to add the categories, check the details, and publish it. It is a dream to manage as it is so fast to add a new shop. I am hugely grateful to Topher for dedicating so much time and care to this when all I expected was the chance to share an idea with others.</p>\n<p>The site already has a sibling &#8211; <a class=\"defanged3-moz-txt-link-abbreviated\" href=\"http://www.stivesandvillages.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.stivesandvillages.co.uk</a> &#8211; set up by my friends Penni and Jo at <a href=\"https://www.kabocreative.com/\">KaboCreative</a>. If you&#8217;re interested in creating something similar to support your community while under lockdown check out Topher&#8217;s <a href=\"https://topher1kenobe.com/cambridge-local-shops-help-during-covid-19/\">technical tips</a> and some special offers we&#8217;ve negotiated with <a href=\"https://wsform.com/\">WSForm</a> and <a href=\"https://generatepress.com/\">GeneratePress</a> to make your life easier and a bit cheaper! Thanks to these companies for their support.</p>\n<h3>What We Learned</h3>\n<p>Here are a few key tips I gave Penni when she got in touch to ask about using my idea for her local area:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>don&#8217;t use logos &#8211; everyone will want their logo used and file quality will vary. So it doesn&#8217;t look like favouritism just make a blanket ban. Choose nice pictures from unsplash.com instead, or simply have one single photo of your town or village in a banner image place. Maybe feature a local photographer who can donate a picture.</li>\n<li>try to focus, at least at first, on shops that are selling vital food stuffs and household goods &#8211; this is what people are looking for urgently.</li>\n<li>don&#8217;t just request info about how they deliver; in a rapidly changing environment shops will be adapting and doing different things. In my area many are doing &#8216;timed collections&#8217; where staff pack your goods for you based on a phone order, and you collect at a specific time by agreement so social contact / crowds / queues are minimised. Some shops are also doing special hours for key workers. Make sure your form is flexible enough to cope with variety and change in how shops are operating.</li>\n<li>be open to including places that don&#8217;t normally sell groceries &#8211; eg pubs have been doing fresh food deliveries to local people and providing a valuable service in my town. They get listed under both &#8216;pubs&#8217; and &#8216;groceries&#8217; on my site.</li>\n<li>create a leaflet that people can print off and share with others, that shops can send out with deliveries &#8211; here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://cambridgelocalshops.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Cant-get-out_-1.pdf\">an example</a> (opens as a PDF).</li>\n<li>many shops won&#8217;t have an online ordering system &#8211; offering them the chance to put a Word document or a PDF order form on your site can be a vital way for them to get information out about their products and contact info. It also means people can print these off and share them with neighbours who don&#8217;t have computers or smart phones.</li>\n<li>make it useful beyond shops &#8211; include local community groups by linking to any reliable pages (eg local municipality / council site) that list them.</li>\n<li>include some medical links to reliable sources (World Health Organisation or national government sites, for example).</li>\n<li>include some activities for those stuck at home &#8211; we have a knitting shop, a martial arts class that&#8217;s now online by video, some arts resources and a dance school doing online lessons! It keeps it local and friendly and relatable for people who know their local area and are looking for reassurance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#8217;ve enjoyed putting this site together, interacting with all the business owners who&#8217;ve entered their details, and making new friends when other people got involved. I highly recommend it as a way of doing something useful in these strange times.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><em>Editor&#8217;s Note</em></h3>\n<p><em>Topher here.

that I love testing out the sort of <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-wacky-world-of-sorta-brilliants-sorta-fun-block-plugins\">fun WordPress blocks</a> that hark back to my early days of the web. I have <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/rebirth-of-creativity-gutenberg-and-the-future-of-wordpress-themes\">written on the subject</a> once or twice. Imagine my surprise when I came across a side-scrolling dinosaur game that users could simply plop into the block editor and provide something fun for their visitors to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-a-saurus/\">Block-a-saurus</a> is a simple game in which you play a T-Rex whose goal is to survive a course of obstacles such as jumping cactuses and ducking birds. To play, you merely need to control the T-Rex via your keyboard&rsquo;s D-pad. It should also work via touch control on mobile devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only bad thing is that I did not notice this gem eight months ago when it was first released to the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;When I started learning about blocks, I realized they could be basically miniature JavaScript applications,&rdquo; said Keanan Koppenhaver, the developer behind Block-a-saurus. &ldquo;I thought this was super interesting as opposed to how WordPress plugins relied more heavily on PHP, so I wanted to see what I could do with basically a blank JavaScript canvas and how that could enable experiences that would have been really difficult to do seamlessly pre-Gutenberg. It slowly went from a &lsquo;Is this even possible?&rsquo; to &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s release it and see if it can inspire people to build something even more out of the box.\'&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Give the game a whirl. Let us know your high score in the comments!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Using the Block-a-saurus Plugin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The plugin is straightforward. Once installed, it adds a new &ldquo;Block-a-saurus!&rdquo; block in the common blocks section of the block inserter.  The block currently has two options under the block settings panel:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Dino Speed:</strong> Allows you to speed up or slow down the movement of the T-Rex in the game.</li><li><strong>Mute Audio:</strong> Allows you to enable or disable the game audio.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting the Block-a-saurus block in the editor.\n\n\n\n<p>By default, the front-end output is bland. Do not expect a graphical powerhouse. However, sometimes, the simplest games can make for hours of fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Default output of Block-a-saurus on the front end.\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to spruce up my game&rsquo;s design on the front end. Therefore, I first inserted a cover block with a dinosaur background, as can be seen at the beginning of this post. I then dropped the plugin&rsquo;s block within the cover block. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This works well with a variety of image backgrounds. Plus, it allows users to put a unique spin on their game.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />A custom background using the cover block around Block-a-saurus.\n\n\n\n<p>There is at least one missing piece that I would like to see in a future version of the plugin. It would be nice to integrate alignment options for the block, such as center, wide, and full alignments that are common with many other blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the plus side, the plugin developer took the few moments necessary to load scripts and styles only on pages where the game is in use. If you want to run the game, you do not have to worry about it loading unnecessary files on every page of your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Future Plugin and Block Plans</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Currently, Block-a-saurus is still sitting at version 1.0. However, Koppenhaver has plans to add extra features to the plugin, such as saving high scores for logged-in users and potentially making the game playable in the backend. The holdup with admin-side playing is some JavaScript conflicts with the native Gutenberg controls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Work is moving along pretty steadily,&rdquo; he said of new features. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to have something relatively small and self-contained to work on in between larger client projects. The saving of scores has been the majority of the work so far, and I&rsquo;m hoping to have that released in the next couple of weeks.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Koppenhaver does not have any immediate plans for similar types of blocks. The plan was for this particular plugin to showcase a fun, one-off block. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen JavaScript implementations of Snake and Tetris, which would be cool to see converted to blocks,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I might have to give one of those a try.&rdquo; Perhaps Block-a-saurus is not the end of the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If he wraps up the work on a front-end, JavaScript-based saving feature for high scores, it would be nice to see that offered as a standalone package for other block developers to use. It would certainly make porting other games such as Snake and Tetris to the block system easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Koppenhaver and his team primarily work on more serious endeavors. &ldquo;We have been working on some other block experiments to allow for things like integrating data sourced from Google Drive as D3 visualizations as well as a block to allow agencies to create better case studies by creating those responsive screenshot mockups you see everywhere and being able to create them completely in Gutenberg,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very excited about the experiences the new editor has allowed us to create and are always experimenting and trying to learn more.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than anything, I want to see other plugin authors launch a few more <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/game/\">games</a> for the block editor.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 18:57:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: The Road Ahead: What’s in Store for WordPress for the Rest of 2020?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=98522\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:193:\"https://wptavern.com/the-road-ahead-whats-in-store-for-wordpress-for-the-rest-of-2020?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-road-ahead-whats-in-store-for-wordpress-for-the-rest-of-2020\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9338:\"<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull has-background-dim-70 has-gray-900-background-color has-background-dim has-parallax bg-gray-900\"><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap has-text-align-left has-extra-large-font-size text-xl text-left\">Full-site editing, automatic theme and plugin updates, global styles, and more await. With the release of <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-4-adderley-released-includes-improved-editor-new-blocks-and-developer-apis\">WordPress 5.4</a> and an open call for <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/open-call-for-wordpress-5-5-tickets-whats-on-your-wish-list\">version 5.5 tickets</a>, it is time to peer into the future and catch a glimpse of what is to come. It is shaping up to be an exciting year thus far.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha Haden, executive director of WordPress, provided a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2020/03/06/update-progress-on-goals/\">progress update on the 2020 goals</a> in early March. As always, the timeline to hit certain goals can change based on roadblocks the development team hits and other factors. On the whole, the tentative roadmap looks feasible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, WordPress 5.5 is set to ship on August 11, 2020. Version 5.6 is scheduled to follow on December 8, 2020.  Some major changes are forthcoming. Let us take a moment to look ahead and see where the WordPress ship is sailing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Automatic Updates for Everything</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Automatic updates column on the plugin management screen.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">We have enjoyed automatic updates for minor versions of core WordPress since version 3.7. However, until recently, it has felt like progress on auto-updating everything had stalled. From mobile phones to smart TVs, the average end-user is accustomed to their software simply staying updated. In 2020, it is time WordPress continues pushing forward, particularly when staying updated is one component of maintaining a secure website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two separate changes centered on automatic updates in the pipeline. The first, which is set to ship in WordPress 5.5, is <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automatic-theme-and-plugin-updates-slated-for-wordpress-5-5\">automatic updates for plugins and themes</a>. The feature plugin has been in development for several months and should be stable enough to launch with the next version of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugin and theme developers will need to adopt a development strategy that aligns more with the WordPress philosophy of maintaining backward compatibility, at least to the point where an automatic update does not break a user&rsquo;s site. This change is a welcome one because it will lead to a more secure web. However, it will be interesting to see how this plays out in the months to come. I am certain there will be a road bump or two that the developer community will need to overcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automatic updates of core WordPress is slated to officially land in version 5.6. It should be an opt-in feature when it rolls out. The feature plugin should also be ready by the time WordPress 5.5 lands.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Directory Integration</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />WordPress.org&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/block/\">block directory page</a>.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The block directory first <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-6-5-adds-experimental-block-directory-search-to-inserter-and-new-social-links-block\">landed in Gutenberg 6.5</a> as an experimental feature. For those of us running the plugin, it is almost easy to forget that it is not already a part of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/block/\">block directory</a> is a listing of a special type of plugin that adds only a single block. In WordPress 5.5, users should be able to search and install blocks from this directory via the post editing screen. If you need a block that is not installed, you can install and begin using it without going through the normal routine with installing a plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Full-Site Editing</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>Live Demo Q&amp;A from <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/theme-templates-full-site-editing-experience-enrique-piqueras/\">The Gutenberg Times</a>.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I am excited about the prospect of full-site editing landing in WordPress. I am concerned that a target date within 2020 may be rushing a feature that may not be ready. I want this to be a successful <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/initial-documentation-for-block-based-wordpress-themes-proposed\">transition of how themes work</a> and how users interact with their sites. I am optimistic about this future, but I am not convinced it will be good enough by the time WordPress 5.6 ships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the introduction of the block editor itself, this will be one of the largest changes to how WordPress works in its history. Arguably, it is a more wide-reaching change because it touches both the backend user interface and how the theme templating system functions. It needs time to age before it&rsquo;s dropped into the laps of end-users and developers alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will be the first to jump for joy if I am wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the plan is to complete the full-site editing feature in the Gutenberg plugin by the time WordPress 5.5 launches. It should still be behind the experimental flag in the plugin at that point. Then, ship the finished product in version 5.6.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Areas (Widgets)</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Using blocks on the experimental block areas screen.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">One of the features that has not gotten near enough attention is the conversion of traditional sidebars into block areas. This is a much-needed change in the mission to turn everything into a block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, it is planned to ship in WordPress 5.6, alongside full-site editing. I would rather see block areas as a stepping stone toward full-site editing. It would be less painful for theme authors to have at least a major release to ease into the next step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The development of this feature could have been much smoother if WordPress would have simply deprecated sidebars and widgets. The Gutenberg team has had to pigeonhole a block-based system into the old widgets system. It is a little messy. Instead of the current approach, they should have created a separate system and allowed theme developers to begin opting into it. Because theme authors are the ones who will be handling support requests from end-users, they should have been given the power to handle that transition gracefully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, there should be no issue making sure block areas are feature-complete by 5.6. Much of the work is finished at this point, and we should be getting a more accurate picture of this feature in the coming months.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Global Styles</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Example mockup from the primary <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/19255\">global styles ticket</a>.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">A new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/19611\">global styles feature</a> is set to ship for WordPress 5.6 later this year. The feature is currently undergoing heavy development. We should begin to see early iterations of it in upcoming versions of the Gutenberg plugin over the next several months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Global styles will allow theme authors to create several default values, likely via a JSON file. In turn, users will be able to overwrite those styles through an interface in the admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My biggest concern about this feature is that it could go overboard with options that end-users should not have to concern themselves with. For example, most users should have no need to adjust the line-height for their text. Instead, line-height values should automatically be calculated based on a font&rsquo;s x-height and size. The question is going to be where the global styles feature will draw the line. At a certain point, it is better to learn CSS. We certainly cannot expose every possibility via an option.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other Notable Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Lazy loading of images, which was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/native-lazy-loading-support-coming-to-wordpress\">originally planned for WordPress 5.4</a>, will be shipping alongside a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/xml-sitemaps-feature-plugin-open-for-testing-and-feedback\">built-in XML sitemaps</a> feature in version 5.5. Both features have been under active development for months and are stable at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-7-0-launches-stable-navigation-block-post-blocks-and-template-parts\">navigation block</a> was complete enough to ship in the previous WordPress release. The block is intended to primarily be used with full-site editing, so the block was not included. However, it is supposed to be available in WordPress 5.5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, we should see a new default theme to propel us into the next year. My guess is that the core leads will want to ship a theme that is built completely on top of the upcoming full-site editing feature. If development goes as currently scheduled, <em>Twenty Twenty-One</em> could be a 100% block-based theme.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 20:54:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Open Call for WordPress 5.5 Tickets: What’s on Your Wish List?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=98435\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:183:\"https://wptavern.com/open-call-for-wordpress-5-5-tickets-whats-on-your-wish-list?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=open-call-for-wordpress-5-5-tickets-whats-on-your-wish-list\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3580:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Now that <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-4-adderley-released-includes-improved-editor-new-blocks-and-developer-apis\">WordPress 5.4</a> has successfully launched, it is time to begin thinking about version 5.5, which has a tentative release date of August 8, 2020. On Wednesday, Josepha Haden, Executive Director of WordPress, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/04/08/wordpress-5-5-call-for-tickets/\">put out a call for tickets</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, the block editor is the top focus as we continually inch toward new features such as a refreshed interface, block patterns, and eventually full-site editing. However, there is room to put a small dent in the thousands of tickets that are still awaiting the right people to move them forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, there are 223 tickets <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major\">assigned to the 5.5 milestone</a>. We are early in the release cycle, so now is the time to advocate for the inclusion of that particular bug fix or enhancement you have had your eye on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What tickets do you want to see addressed?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wish List: Finished Custom Post Status API</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">While I have no expectations that my personal wish list item will make the WordPress 5.5 cut, it does not mean that I cannot hope. After <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12706\">10 years in the making</a>, with a fix here and there, I would love to see custom post statuses become feature complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good example use case for custom post statuses is forum plugins. Topics or threads can either have an open or closed status. There are other cases such as archive, spam, hidden, and orphan statuses. Management of forums typically happens on the site front end, so plugin authors usually build custom front-end solutions to handle statuses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scenarios where users need to assign a post status in the admin is where things get tricky. In the past, it was a <em>simple</em> matter of recreating the &ldquo;publish&rdquo; meta box on the edit post screen with a custom status dropdown. With the block editor, I am sure it is possible to do something similar with JavaScript. If so, this still leaves plugin authors in a bind. They will need to code at least two methods to pigeonhole custom statuses into the WordPress editor &mdash; three if also doing so on the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is time we have a complete post status API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lack of custom status support in the core user interface has created several roadblocks for projects I have worked on through the years. At one point, there seemed to be some traction to make this a reality, but it seems to have fallen to the wayside as more important and shinier features have been given the green light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Custom post statuses are as easy to register as custom post types and taxonomies. The primary missing element is the UI integration on the post editing screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a real need for this feature as outlined by developers in a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3144\">related Gutenberg ticket</a>. Some agencies and organizations with a more complex editing workflow cannot move forward with the block editor on some projects, even if they want to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/imath/wp-statuses\">WP Statuses</a> plugin by Mathieu Viet could ease the pain for developers with its integration with both the block and classic editors. However, this level of integration belongs in the core software.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 19:54:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"WPTavern: State of the Meetup Under Lockdown\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=98421\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:133:\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-meetup-under-lockdown?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=state-of-the-meetup-under-lockdown\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6466:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">By now we&rsquo;re all getting weary of the phrase &ldquo;new normal.&rdquo; Much ink has been spilled over the question of what that new normal will look like after the pandemic has passed over us. There&rsquo;s a stubborn streak in the American national character that admits of little change but, like an assiduous puppy, finds what works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been attending the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Asheville-Area-WordPress-Group\">local WordPress Meetup</a>&nbsp;since moving to Asheville, North Carolina, three years ago. Finding myself in a new city, getting out into the community and meeting people in the same industry seemed like a good opportunity to get connected. And it worked. I&rsquo;ve lived in a handful of cities, and nothing has worked faster and better in getting me acclimated to a new locale. As I write now from a sort of exile, present circumstances make clear why the meetup matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community is a naturally diverse one. But diversity itself is neither inherently good nor bad. Developers all over the world may commit to the same codebase, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re all together. Working among GitHub avatars and social media accounts alone, it&rsquo;s easy to allow in-group preference to collect and fester and eventually spill out; as it did recently with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/on-maga-caps-and-wordcamps\">brouhaha about a certain baseball cap</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress meetup is an in-group breaker. People of wildly different backgrounds manage to come together around a common theme (sometimes literally a&nbsp;<em>theme</em>). We meet in person, face to face, catch up on old things, and learn all new things. Depending on who you sit next to, you might even hear a dirty joke. We get the all-important sense of being in what the ancient Greeks called the&nbsp;<em>polis</em>, the city-state. We&rsquo;re all different, but Asheville is our city-state, and WordPress is why, twice a month, we get out of our homes and assemble. When we talk about democratizing publishing that means for&nbsp;<em>everyone</em>. This is why the meetup is important, and why it must go on even during a pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>At the meetup, we&rsquo;re not just learning about WordPress. We&rsquo;re learning about each other. Business cards change hands. Smiles and handshakes lighten the air. Asheville is a beer town, so there&rsquo;s often a brew before, sometimes during, and always after. This kind of fellowship is a critical ingredient to building a tight-knit group, yet it&rsquo;s what we sacrifice first when the order to keep &ldquo;social distance&rdquo; comes down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Social distance?</em> I thought. <em>How is it possible to even have a meetup under such frosty circumstances?</em> But have a meetup we did&mdash;at least virtually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the order to distance and stay at home came down, I canceled my &ldquo;Basics of SEO&rdquo; presentation and pondered whether the meetup will simply have to wait until the virus clears. John Dorner, a local developer and arch-organizer, decided we must give the virtual thing a try. Who knows how long we&rsquo;ll be barred from gathering?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days we&rsquo;re all familiar with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://meet.google.com/\">Google Meet</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.skype.com/en/\">Skype</a>, and a host of other video conference tools. I&rsquo;ve been working remotely for three years now, and regular video meetings are part of my weekly routine. It&rsquo;s not that the video conference software isn&rsquo;t perfectly adequate, but there is a lack of warmth about it. It&rsquo;s perfunctory, a means to an end. But maybe I was wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the virtual meeting launches, we have the usual throat-clearing and the customary hiccups. Ambient noise. Broken microphones and webcams require certain attendees to post chat comments. But we finally get down to business. Dorner encourages all the new people to join the Slack channel, where members can post questions, get help, and continue the conversation after the meetup. We spin a digital wheel of fortune to decide who gets the free JetBrains license&mdash;our regular giveaway, which I&rsquo;ve won twice now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon, John presents his screen and shows us how we can better manage large clusters of media files in our WordPress sites. It all goes off without a hitch. I volunteer to give my talk at the next meeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our Asheville area group has a long list of subscribers. Yet, we only see a fraction of that RSVP regularly. Often, people will RSVP but not be able to attend. More universal topics tend to bring out larger crowds. For some, making it out to a 6 PM meeting on a weeknight is a big ask.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefit of the virtual meetup is that it gives those with busier schedules and longer travel times a chance to attend a topic they&rsquo;re interested in but may have otherwise skipped. We miss out on the fellowship, but we get the knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />John Dorner performs impressive card magic.\n\n\n\n<p>As time and space allow, we can consider what the long term outlook might be. Right now, it&rsquo;s just a series of if/then statements. We&rsquo;re all waiting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the virtual meetup came to a close, it occurred to me that we could probably expand our boundaries a little bit. I can invite coworkers in Virginia Beach to check out our local meetup. I could invite family from Florida if they were interested. But then, would the Asheville WordPress Meetup lose its local flavor? Is that a bad thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, the pandemic will pass, as all pandemics do. The meetup may land on the hybrid model, having virtual meetings from time to time while keeping the live thing going. I hope we&rsquo;ll find a happy mix. A meetup without the local flavor, and the camaraderie, would not be the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if handshakes are replaced with elbow bumps, and we learn to stop touching our faces and to sneeze into our shirts, we need a place to go where we can assemble to keep the polis lively. Change is inevitable, and there&rsquo;s nothing new about &ldquo;new normals,&rdquo; but we don&rsquo;t do ourselves any favors by canceling what we know works best. Our exile on our personal Elbas will end, and we must go back out into society not as frightened peasants but rather as Napoleons of the new normal&mdash;whatever that will be.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 16:03:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Chris Maiorana\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"Matt: Distributed Work’s Five Levels of Autonomy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=51231\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"https://ma.tt/2020/04/five-levels-of-autonomy/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8869:\"<p>I recently had the opportunity to sit down with <a href=\"https://samharris.org/\">Sam Harris</a>, author and host of the <em>Making Sense</em> podcast, <a href=\"https://samharris.org/podcasts/194-new-future-work/\">for a wide-ranging conversation</a>. Given the moment we’re currently living through, we naturally touched on the way companies are adapting to a new reality — one where remote work is a model to which they must adapt in a matter of days, rather than years.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned to Sam on the podcast, “any company that can enable their people to be fully effective in a distributed fashion, can and should do it far beyond after this current crisis has passed.” <em>It&#8217;s a moral imperative.</em> But that doesn’t mean it’s going to be easy, or that the chaotic and stressful first taste some workplaces are getting right now is one that inspires them to keep trying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make sense of this journey — from a company’s cautious exploration of remote possibilities to a fully realized distributed experience — I like to think of how it plays out through the concept of levels of distributed work, which I modeled after <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car#Classification\">self-driving car levels of autonomy</a>. I’ve seen some solid recaps of my conversation with Sam from <a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/the-five-levels-of-remote-work-and-why-youre-probably-at-level-2-ccaf05a25b9c\">Steve Glaveski</a> and <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/49755484227/\">Steve Jurvetson</a>, but here’s my gist of how distributed companies evolve:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"0\"><li><strong>Level Zero</strong> autonomy is a job which cannot be done unless you&#8217;re physically there. Imagine construction worker, barista, massage therapist, firefighter&#8230; Many companies assumed they had far more of these than it has turned out they really did.</li><li>The <strong>first level</strong> is where most colocated businesses are: there’s no deliberate effort to make things remote-friendly, though in the case of many knowledge workers, people can keep things moving for a day or two when there’s an emergency. More often than not, they’ll likely put things off until they’re back in the office. Work happens on company equipment, in company space, on company time. You don&#8217;t have any special equipment and may have to use a clunky VPN to access basic work resources like email or your calendar. Larger level one companies often have people in the same building or campus dialing into a meeting. Level one companies were largely unprepared for this crisis.</li><li><strong>Level two</strong> is where many companies have found themselves in the past few weeks with the COVID-19 pandemic. They’ve accepted that work is going to happen at home for a while, but they recreate what they were doing in the office in a &#8220;remote&#8221; setting, like <a href=\"https://www.marshallmcluhan.com/\">Marshall McLuhan</a> talked about new media mediums initially copying the generation before. You’re probably able to access information from afar, you’ve adapted to tools like Zoom or Microsoft Teams, but everything is still synchronous, your day is full of interruptions, no real-time meetings have been canceled (yet), and there’s a lot of anxiety in management around productivity — that’s the stage where companies sometimes install surveillance software on laptops. Pro tip: Don’t do that! And also: Don’t stop at level two!</li><li>At the <strong>third level</strong>, you’re really starting to benefit from being remote-first, or <strong>distributed</strong>. That’s when you see people invest in better equipment — from a good desk lamp to <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2020/03/dont-mute-get-a-better-headset/\">solid audio gear</a> — and in more robust asynchronous processes that start to replace meetings. It’s also the point at which you realize just how crucial written communication is for your success, and you start looking for great writers in your hiring. When you are on a Zoom, you often also have a Google Doc up with the other meeting participants so you can take and check real-time notes together. Your company has a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp\">zero-trust BeyondCorp security model</a>. In a non-pandemic world you plan meetups so teams can break bread and meet each other in person a week or two a year.</li><li><strong>Level four</strong> is when things go truly asynchronous. You evaluate people’s work on what they produce, not how or when they produce it. Trust emerges as the glue that holds the entire operation together. You begin shifting to better — perhaps slower, but more deliberate — decision-making, and you empower everyone, not just the loudest or most extroverted, to weigh in on major conversations. You tap into the global talent pool, the 99% of the world&#8217;s population and intelligence that doesn&#8217;t live near one of your legacy physical office locations. Employee retention goes way up, and you invest more in training and coaching. Most employees have home-office setups that would make office workers green with envy. You have a rich social life with people you choose. Real-time meetings are respected and taken seriously, almost always have agendas and pre-work or post-work. If you <a href=\"https://spikes.worldathletics.org/post/japans-secret-to-relay-success\">get good at baton passes</a> work will follow the sun 24/7 around the world. Your organization is truly inclusive because standards are objective and give people agency to accomplish their work their way.</li><li>Finally, I believe it’s always useful to have an ideal that’s not wholly attainable — and that’s <strong>level five, Nirvana!</strong> This is when you consistently perform better than any in-person organization could. You&#8217;re effortlessly effective. It’s when everyone in the company has time for wellness and mental health, when people bring their best selves and highest levels of creativity to do the best work of their careers, and just have fun. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f920.png\" alt=\"🤠\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>A highly influential book for me in designing Automattic was <a href=\"https://www.danpink.com/books/drive/\">Daniel Pink’s <em>Drive</em></a>, where he eloquently introduces the three things that really matter in motivating people: mastery, purpose, and autonomy. <strong>Mastery</strong> is the urge to get better skills. <strong>Purpose</strong> is the desire to do something that has meaning, that&#8217;s bigger than yourself. These first two principles physically co-located companies can be great at. But the third, autonomy, is where even the best in-office company can never match a Level 4 or above distributed company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Autonomy</strong> is our desire to be self-directed, to have agency over ourselves and our environment. Close your eyes and imagine everything around you in a physical office: the chair you&#8217;re in, the desk, distance from a window, the smells, the temperature, the music, the flooring, what&#8217;s in the fridge, the comfort and privacy of the bathrooms, the people (or pets) around you, the lighting. Now imagine an environment where you can choose and control every one of those to your liking — maybe it&#8217;s a room in your house, a converted garage, a shared studio, or really anything, the important thing is you&#8217;re able to shape the environment fit your personal preferences, not the lowest common denominator of everyone an employer has decided to squish together for 8 hours a day. The micro-interactions of the hundreds of variables of your work environment can charge you and give you creative energy, or make you dependent, infantilized, and a character in someone else&#8217;s story. Which do you want to spend half of your waking workday hours in?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a good summary of Dan Pink, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc\">check out this animation</a>.

Part of me wants to tell folks that there has never been a greater time in human history to find something to do at home. There is a plethora of content available at the touch of a finger or even voice command.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have built a system, the web, that provides education, entertainment, and art at near-instantaneous speeds. Our WordPress community is a large part of that human endeavor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the problem lies with our consumerist culture. With large social media networks effectively taking over the web, the trend seems to suggest that people spend their free time glued to their mobile devices, consuming content created by others. Now that many are home full time, it is easy to grow tired of consuming content that would normally be reserved for free time at all hours of the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asking what the elders in my family did in their free time decades ago, before modern technological advances, I noticed a different trend. They created music. On my grandmother&rsquo;s side of the family, that musicality in our genes produced Hank Williams. On my grandfather&rsquo;s side, we had The Tadlock Quartet, a little-known gospel group. If our family had a motto, it would be: <em>if you don&rsquo;t sing or play an instrument, you are not a Tadlock</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have an uncle who is a painter and magician. Some of my cousins are in a band. My sister creates vases, tabletops, and other pieces out of broken glass when she&rsquo;s not chasing her two-year-old. My father is a singer, songwriter, and multi-instrument musician. I could go on listing the art that my family creates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe I was fortunate to grow up in an artistic environment. That artistry has never been about fame and fortune. Most of my family will never reach stardom. However, we continue creating because it is simply a part of who we are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also reminisce over my childhood years. I grew up in a lower-middle-class household. We did not have the luxury of the internet. We could not afford cable or satellite television. The only channels on the tube were 8, 12, 20, and sometimes 32. It was the era of the Saturday morning cartoon block, which I gladly awoke to every weekend with my off-brand cereal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many kids of my generation, I had a video game console and a handful of games. But, there are only so many times you can play through <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> before finding something else to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of my childhood was spent creating things. I ran several issues of a homemade video game magazine, painstakingly drawing all the artwork by hand. Fortunately, my uncle had a printer and scanner so that I could make copies. I wrote short stories, crafted screenplays, and filmed movies on a borrowed camcorder. I built tree forts that probably would not have passed any level of building safety codes, but my friends and I survived.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had about a three-year stint in the mid-&rsquo;90s in which I fashioned myself a songwriter, following in my father&rsquo;s footsteps (he has never sold a song but continues writing music to this day). I do not think I wrote anything other than love songs. What else would a 12-year-old boy write about? My only experience with love was a peck on the cheek from a previous girlfriend. Despite my naivete in matters of the heart, the human soul knows what it needs, and I expressed that through lyrics in the style of whatever boyband was popular in the given month. My music was not Grammy-worthy material, but it was deeply human.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I grew into adulthood, I did not stop creating. My journey into the world of WordPress began only because I wanted to share my writing. Eventually, I learned to create a new type of art: WordPress plugins and themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over my near-15 years of working with WordPress, my primary interest became more about building things that would help others to create. Even today, as a writer for the Tavern, my hope is to spark discussions and response articles that others create on their own blogs. This should never be a one-way discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many others, I recently found myself in a position with &ldquo;nothing to do.&rdquo; For the previous several months, I had been working on a plugin development book during my free time. Suddenly, I found myself with an empty calendar for an entire weekend. No social gatherings. No book chapters due. That meant putting my artist hat firmly back on my head. It was time to enjoy the act of creation for the sake of it, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/create-custom-patterns-with-the-block-pattern-builder-plugin\">which led to a new plugin</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It felt good to once again create something with no expectations. I was not getting paid to build this project. I wanted neither fame nor fortune. What I needed was a moment to express an idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The act of creating art is a primal part of our nature. The plugin was my modern-day equivalent of sitting around the campfire and crafting a story of slaying a great beast that happened upon the village.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a firm believer that every human has the capacity to create some form of artwork. A novel. A dance. A song. I have seen farmers with gardens so well-tended they would make you weep. I have watched a man with an intellectual disability hand-build intricate birdhouses. I have sat in astonishment, listening as a friend&rsquo;s mother put together an entire piano arrangement after hearing a song only once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the same reason, I am proud to be a part of the WordPress community. I am surrounded by artists in their own right daily. We create software that allows others to share their creations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When someone tells me they are bored during this social quarantine, I break out my speech about using this moment to create something. <em>Anything.</em> It does not need to have value to others. It should simply be an expression of one&rsquo;s self. If they follow through, I give them a speech about building a site with WordPress to share what they have built.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, now is not the time for boredom. It should be a time of pure creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create a shop with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/\">WooCommerce</a> for those handcrafted items you have been wanting to build for years. Build up your inventory right now so that it is ready to ship after the pandemic has passed. Write an e-book and sell it via <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/\">Easy Digital Downloads</a>. Start a local fundraising effort to help those in need in your neighborhood with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/give/\">Give WP</a> plugin. Create a new forum with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/\">bbPress</a> on your favorite TV series or some other topic that piques your interest. Start a regular ol&rsquo; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> blog and share your thoughts during this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use this brief moment in history to create something new. Whether it is a side hustle, a new business, or poetry, just create. Then, of course, share it via your WordPress website.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 09 Apr 2020 20:11:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Europe 2020 Is Moving Online This Summer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=98377\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:163:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2020-is-moving-online-this-summer?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordcamp-europe-2020-is-moving-online-this-summer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3992:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">On Monday, the WordCamp Europe team <a href=\"https://2020.europe.wordcamp.org/2020/04/06/wordcamp-europe-2020-is-moving-online/\">announced it would hold its annual event</a> online from June 4-6. The move comes after initially postponing this year&rsquo;s physical event because of the COVID-19 pandemic currently sweeping the globe. Like many other events, the organizing team is in the process of switching gears and moving everything to work over the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Europe 2020 Online will hold a virtual contributor day on June 4. The last two days of the event will consist of live-streamed sessions and workshops for half days. The team is still working out the details and will keep everyone updated when possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reopening of the event to a virtual audience was met with enthusiasm when the team <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WCEurope/status/1247196801393885184\">announced it on Twitter</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&#128227; We&rsquo;re back! We are excited to announce WordCamp Europe 2020 Online &ndash; a virtual event taking place on 4-6 June &#127881; Add the dates back into your diaries and stay tuned for more details coming soon &#128197; <a href=\"https://t.co/JdEEHN0GMT\">https://t.co/JdEEHN0GMT</a></p>&mdash; WordCamp Europe (@WCEurope) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WCEurope/status/1247196801393885184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 6, 2020</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Last month, the organizers delivered the news that they would be postponing the 2020 physical event. &ldquo;The decision to postpone WCEU 2020 was not made lightly, as each member of the organising team is deeply invested in the event, but it was made collectively,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://2020.europe.wordcamp.org/2020/03/12/important-notice-wordcamp-europe-postponed/\">wrote the team on the WordCamp EU blog</a>. &ldquo;[The community] is, by far, the most heartbreaking part of a cancellation: the fact that we won&rsquo;t get to gather together in person, to connect, share knowledge and inspire one another during our sessions, hallway tracks, and dinners.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The organizers are rebooting the physical WordCamp EU event for 2021. Last month, the team <a href=\"https://2020.europe.wordcamp.org/2020/03/24/wordcamp-europe-2021-dates-confirmed/\">confirmed June 3-5</a> for next year&rsquo;s event. It will take place at the Super Bock Arena (Pavilh&atilde;o Rosa Mota) in Porto, Portugal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who purchased tickets to the 2020 event, they should have already received a refund or get one by April 10. Organizers are in the process of contacting sponsors to discuss refunds and getting involved in the online event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The silver lining in this news is that everyone can attend WordCamp EU at no cost, albeit virtually rather than in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the size of the event, WordCamp EU will be the standard that many other events and meetups will likely want to emulate and build upon. It will be a test of how the WordPress community can come together and show the world that we can continue doing great things during uncertain times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that the current virus outbreak will likely continue through the summer, everyone in the WordPress community should mark this event on their calendars. Make social plans with the people who love the same software. It is free, and you are probably going to be home anyway. I look forward to an exciting event from the European WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To stay up to date on WordCamp EU or contact the team, follow its social networking accounts:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WCEurope/\">WCEU Facebook</a></li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wceurope?lang=en\">WCEU Twitter</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/wordcampeurope/\">WCEU LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wceurope/?hl=en\">WCEU Instagram</a></li></ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 08 Apr 2020 19:18:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"HeroPress: Embrace Who You Are and Others Will Follow\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=3095\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:158:\"https://heropress.com/essays/embrace-who-you-are-and-others-will-follow/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=embrace-who-you-are-and-others-will-follow\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10634:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/040720-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: No one is excluded from carving their place in the WordPress industry.\" /><p><strong>Wondering how a university drop out with ADHD and a criminal record found a spot in the WordPress community? Read on to see why it’s often your “faults” that can make you a major asset to any product team.</strong></p>\n<p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve had a knack for spotting an opportunity to make money. Even as an industrious seven-year-old, I knew that if I spent my birthday money on a value-size container of gumballs, I could sell them off to my classmates for a profit.</p>\n<p>Soon, every school recess and bus ride was a chance to make a sale and as I grew, so did my appetite for the hustle. Eventually, I replaced gumballs with mowing lawns and later, importing and reselling electronics. As long as there was a demand, nothing was off-limits.</p>\n<p>At this point, you may be expecting the rest of my story to go something like “serial entrepreneur switches to digital products, joins the WordPress community, and lives happily ever after,” right?</p>\n<p>Well, there are a lot more twists and turns before that since my hustling did end up getting me into a lot of trouble. My WordPress origin story includes a tale of how I escaped government spies in China, served a prison sentence in Kansas, and ultimately turned my mixed bag of (decidedly non-technical) business and people skills into a marketing position at Sandhills Development.</p>\n<a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/open-premiere-wcus-alain-schlesser-tyler-lau_700-min.jpg\"><img /></a>Tyler Lau with Alain Schlesser at the Open Film premiere at WCUS 2019 in St.Louis.\n<h3>Jack of all trades, master of fun</h3>\n<p>One of the many reasons I’m always on the lookout for new projects and business opportunities is my Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a diagnosis I received nearly 14 years ago. As the only child of a divorced couple, all the attention was on me, but I couldn’t seem to keep my attention on anything.</p>\n<p>Luckily, the disorder that made me a restless child has made me a creative and adaptable adult. In my current role, I’m a marketing relationship builder at Sandhills Development, a plugin company with a portfolio of brands including AffiliateWP, Easy Digital Downloads, and Restrict Content Pro. Unlike most people at Sandhills who focus on one or two of our products, my role spans across all our digital properties.</p>\n<p>Not only am I representing a portfolio of products, but for each, my tasks involve post-sales communication, partnership, and affiliate development, B2B sales, and event marketing. Behind the scenes, I also organize our company retreats, book WordCamp travel arrangements, and even helped open two Sandhills breweries in Kansas. That’s right, we branched out of tech into beer!</p>\n<p>In a way, I’m the people person at Sandhills Development and the face of the company to many in the WordPress community. In an industry built by programmers and developers with outstanding focus and attention to detail, someone with ADHD wouldn’t seem like a natural fit. And yet, the WordPress community really is one of those places where everyone can find the right spot for their unique mix of skills. For me, my skill was people, and that has translated into a slew of responsibilities.</p>\n<a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WordCamp-seattle-min.jpg\"><img /></a>Chatting with sponsors at WordCamp Seattle 2019\n<h3>Relationship-building as a career</h3>\n<p>On paper, there isn’t much that qualifies me to work for a tech company. Most of my previous experience was in the restaurant industry, something I’m still quite passionate about. That’s probably why I am always in charge of food at our company retreats. In fact, even though I was far from a Luddite, nothing on my CV pointed to a career in tech. And yet, that fast-paced, customer-facing service industry environment has actually prepared me the best for everything I’ve taken on since.</p>\n<p>When I’m at events on behalf of Sandhills, I’m meeting people from all over the world and developing personal and professional relationships with them, all while managing the logistics of event marketing. As an extrovert, I love it and I couldn’t imagine a job that didn’t involve relationship-building.</p>\n<p>Understanding people and being able to operate in any setting isn’t just an asset to grow a company, it can also be key to surviving in precarious environments. While my social tact is useful for making friends and building community in the WordPress space, at one point in my life, it was necessary for survival. Like the time I went to prison.</p>\n<h3>The true meaning of freedom</h3>\n<p>In the WordPress community, the concept of freedom comes up often. The GPL, free software, open-source communities&#8230;These are all fundamental values on which WordPress is built. Practically speaking, anyone can launch a company, become a freelancer, work remotely, or be their own boss to gain more freedom in their work and life. This is particularly appealing to me as someone who has never fit into the traditional work mold and as someone who now values my freedom more than ever.</p>\n<a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WCA2-Tracy-Josepha-DeRosia-girls-min.jpg\"><img /></a>With attendees at WordCamp Ann Arbor 2019\n<p>Six years ago, my inner opportunist got me into trouble with the law selling marijuana. It was a quick way to make good money and after dropping out of college following a brain aneurysm, I needed capital to fund my first startup. Between my shifts as a waiter, I worked on prototypes for my first product. The company was growing fast and to protect my patents and take R&amp;D to the next level, I had to work really hard.</p>\n<p>Everything came to a screeching halt when I went to prison. If you’re wondering if prison is like TV shows and movies, the answer is both yes and no. It’s harder in a lot of ways but my spirit never broke. Meeting other inmates reminded me that I was in a much better situation than most. I was educated, well-off, loved, and knew I had a future once I was released.</p>\n<p>Many inmates never graduated from high school and are completely computer illiterate. While on the inside, I taught science, math, writing, reading, and social studies. But still, I know many of them will struggle to get the mental health support and the job training they need to thrive after they serve their sentence. There’s more to freedom than just being on the outside. You also need a sense of agency and enfranchisement. As for me, my sense of purpose and my support network were plenty to keep me going and I was ready to take on my next (legal) business challenge as soon as I could.</p>\n<a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WordCamp-us-2019-min.jpg\"><img /></a>With sponsors and organizers at WCUS 2019 in St. Louis\n<h3>Your past doesn’t define you but you can choose to embrace it</h3>\n<p>I’m an outlier in many ways. From the day I was born, I was political. My father is a semi-dissident Chinese visual anthropologist and my mother is an art professor who left her home country of Japan to break from traditional Japanese gender roles. If you’re familiar with the history between these two nations, you’ll know a relationship between their citizens is rare and discouraged. I inherited a lot of that fearlessness, although I’m not sure if it’s nurture or nature. Most of my childhood was split, either following my father around the world, as he documented Chinese communities, or growing up as one of few Asian-Americans living in small-town Kansas.</p>\n<p>I’ve never fit in, and yet this is what makes me able to adapt to most situations and relate to just about anyone. I embrace my eclectic, dissonant past and see beauty in the person those experiences shaped me to be. Now, I’m able to put those skills to good use in the WordPress community and beyond. Regardless of your level of physical ability, your struggles with mental health, your upbringing, and even your run-ins with the law, no one is excluded from carving their place in the WordPress industry.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Embrace Who You Are and Others Will Follow\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Embrace%20Who%20You%20Are%20and%20Others%20Will%20Follow&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fembrace-who-you-are-and-others-will-follow%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Embrace Who You Are and Others Will Follow\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fembrace-who-you-are-and-others-will-follow%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fembrace-who-you-are-and-others-will-follow%2F&title=Embrace+Who+You+Are+and+Others+Will+Follow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Embrace Who You Are and Others Will Follow\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/embrace-who-you-are-and-others-will-follow/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/040720-min-150x150.jpg&description=Embrace Who You Are and Others Will Follow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Embrace Who You Are and Others Will Follow\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/embrace-who-you-are-and-others-will-follow/\" title=\"Embrace Who You Are and Others Will Follow\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/embrace-who-you-are-and-others-will-follow/\">Embrace Who You Are and Others Will Follow</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 08 Apr 2020 09:00:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Tyler Lau\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WordPress.org blog: People of WordPress: Mario Peshev\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=8536\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/04/people-of-wordpress-mario-peshev/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10574:\"<p><em>You’ve probably heard that WordPress is open source software, and may know that it’s created and run by volunteers. Enthusiasts share many examples of how WordPress has changed people’s lives for the better. In this monthly series, we share some of those lesser-known, amazing stories.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Computer science in the nineties</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/04/25de575216d3743f80181b2dca2cd7d9.jpeg?w=632&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8539\" />Mario Peshev</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Mario has been hooked on computers ever since he&nbsp;got his first one in 1996. He started with digging into MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 first and learned tons by trial and error. Following that adventure, Mario built his first HTML site in 1999. He found development so exciting that he spent day and night learning QBasic and started working at the local PC game club. Mario got involved with several other things related to website administration (translating security bulletins, setting up simple sites, etc) and soon found the technology field was full of activities he really enjoyed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Corporate Lifestyle</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mario started studying programming including an intensive high-level course for C#, Java development, and software engineering, and eventually got a job in a corporate environment. He soon became a team lead there, managing all the planning and paperwork for their projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But he continued freelancing on the side. He grew his own network of technical experts through attending, volunteering at, and organizing conferences. He also ran a technical forum and regularly spoke at universities and enterprise companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Remote Working and Business Opportunity</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The combination of a high workload and a daily three-hour-long commute made Mario’s life difficult. Many of his friends were still studying, traveling or unemployed. The blissful and calm lives they lived seemed like a fairy tale to him. And even while both his managers and his clients were abroad, he was unable to obtain permission to work remotely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Mario decided to leave his job and start freelancing full time. But he found he faced a massive challenge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He discovered Java projects were pretty large and required an established team of people working together in an office. All job opportunities were on-site, and some even required relocation abroad. Certified Java programmers weren’t being hired on a remote basis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Mario had some PHP experience from previous jobs, he used this to start his freelance career. For his projects, he used both plain PHP and PHP frameworks like CakePHP and CodeIgniter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a while, Mario accepted work using commonly known platforms including Joomla, Drupal, and WordPress. In addition, he worked on PHP, Java, Python and some C# projects for a couple of years, after which he decided to switch to WordPress completely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Building products</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of his projects involved a technically challenging charity backed by several international organizations. Unexpected shortages in the team put him in the technical lead position. As a result, Mario found himself planning the next phases, meeting with the client regularly, and renegotiating the terms. The team completed the project successfully, and after the launch, a TV campaign led millions of visitors to the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result of the successful launch, this client invited Mario to participate in more WordPress projects, including building a custom framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“I wasn’t that acquainted with WordPress back then. For me, a conventional person trained in architectural design patterns and best practices, WordPress seemed like an eccentric young hipster somewhere on the line between insane and genius at the same time. I had to spend a couple of months learning WordPress from the inside out.”</em></p><cite>Mario Peshev</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As his interest in WordPress grew, Mario stopped delivering other custom platforms, and converted clients to WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>European Community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/04/20191001_144227-scaled.jpg?fit=632%2C356&ssl=1\" alt=\"Mario presenting to an audience\" class=\"wp-image-8546\" />Mario presenting at a WordCamp\n\n\n\n<p>For Mario, one of the key selling points of WordPress was the international openness. He had previously been involved with other open source communities, some of which were US-focused. He felt they were more reliant on meeting people in person. With events only taking place in the US, this made building relationships much harder for people living in other countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the WordPress project started out in the US, the WordPress community quickly globalized. Dozens of WordCamps and hundreds of Meetup events take place around the globe every year.&nbsp; All of these events bring a wide variety of people sharing their enthusiasm for WordPress together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Mario, the birth of WordCamp Europe was something magical. The fact that hundreds, and later on thousands, of people from all over the world gathered around the topic of WordPress speaks for itself. Mario has been involved with organizing WordCamp Europe twice (in 2014 and 2015).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“There’s nothing like meeting WordPress enthusiasts and professionals from more than 50 countries brainstorming and working together at a WordCamp. You simply have to be there to understand how powerful it all is.”</em></p><cite>Mario Peshev</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Growing businesses and teams</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A key WordPress benefit is its popularity – an ever growing project currently powering <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress\">more than 35% of the Internet [2020].</a> It’s popular enough to be a de facto standard for websites, platforms, e-commerce and blogs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has a low barrier to entry. You can achieve a lot without being an expert, meaning most people can start gaining experience without having to spend years learning how to code. That also makes it easier to build businesses and teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“Being able to use a tool that is user-friendly, not overly complicated and easily extensible makes introducing it to team members faster and easier. It requires less time for adjustment, and as a result makes a team stronger and faster. The fact that this tool is cost-effective also allows more startups to enter the market. It requires&nbsp; less time and investments to launch an MVP. This boosts the entire ecosystem.”</em></p><cite>Mario Peshev</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Helping Others</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mario also introduced WordPress to children and young people. He taught them how to use WordPress as a tool for homework and class assignments. By using WordPress, they were able to learn the basics of designing themes, developing plugins, marketing statistics, social media, copywriting, and so much more. This approachable introduction to the software meant technical skills were not needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was also part of a team of volunteers who helped a group of young people living at a foster home struggling to provide for themselves. The team taught the basic digital literacy skills necessary in the modern workplace and potentially pay for their rent and basic needs. This included working with Microsoft Word, Excel and WordPress, as well as some basic design and marketing skills. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“When you look at that from another perspective, a platform that could save lives &#8211; literally &#8211; and change the world for better is worth contributing to, in any possible manner.”</em></p><cite>Mario Peshev</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Contributing to the WordPress community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From the core team to supporting and organizing WordCamps, Mario has long been an active contributor to the global WordPress project. He is passionate about the connections fostered by people who are involved in building both the WordPress software and the community around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“The WordPress community consists of people of all race and color, living all around the world, working as teachers, developers, bloggers, designers, business owners. Let’s work together to help each other. Let’s stick together and show&nbsp; the world WordPress can help make it a better place.”</em></p><cite>Mario Peshev</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Contributors</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Alison Rothwell (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/wpfiddlybits/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>wpfiddlybits</a>), Yvette Sonneveld (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/yvettesonneveld/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>yvettesonneveld</a>), Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>webcommsat</a>), Josepha Haden (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>chanthaboune</a>) and Topher DeRosia (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>topher1kenobe</a>).

The move should make it more affordable for small sites to use the service. Larger sites might have to shell out more money, depending on how much content is on the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Jetpack Search had only been available as a part of the Jetpack Professional plan at $29 per month, but that pricing felt unfair: a site with one million posts costs 1,000 times as much to index as a site with one thousand posts, but both sites were paying the same amount,&rdquo; wrote Greg Brown, search wrangler at Automattic, in the announcement post. &ldquo;New pricing makes Jetpack Search more affordable for small sites and still costs big sites less than the competition.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jetpack Search now charges by the number of records:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Up to 100 records: $5 per month</li><li>Up to 1,000 records: $10 per month</li><li>Up to 10,000 records: $25 per month</li><li>Up to 100,000 records: $60 per month</li><li>Up to 1 million records: $200 per month</li><li>Over 1 million records: $200 per month per million records</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Records&rdquo; are posts, pages, and custom post types. However, that may change in the future. &ldquo;We decided to use the term &lsquo;records&rsquo; because we think there are use cases where we may want to index comments as their own records sometime in the future,&rdquo; said Brown. &ldquo;Similarly, there are use cases for indexing authors, tags, categories, etc. as their own records.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jetpack Search combines comments and bbPress plugin replies, which are technically a custom post type, with their parent post. For now, these will not count against users&rsquo; record counts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One caveat with search is that media attachments are considered individual records by default. There are good reasons for some sites to expose attachments via search results. However, this could lead to unwanted records and cost more money each month for users who have a lot of media but do not wish to count those pages. Jetpack does have a filter hook that <a href=\"https://developer.jetpack.com/hooks/jetpack_sync_prevent_sending_post_data/\">controls which post types are cached</a> on the WordPress.com servers, so this can at least be configured via code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 8.4 of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/\">Jetpack plugin</a> also includes an updated search interface. When a site visitor enters a search query, a fullscreen modal appears to showcase the search results. The results are snappy because they rely on the WordPress.com API and updated technology underneath. The new interface should work well with most themes out of the box on both desktop and mobile views.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Jetpack search results modal.\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This new version of Search is only available with the new plan,&rdquo; said Brown. &ldquo;The previous version of Search is still available on the Pro plan and will continue working as-is for the foreseeable future, but our focus going forward is on the new search experience.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Architecture Behind Jetpack Search</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The new version of Jetpack Search runs on a re-architected technology layer. The old system was an Elasticsearch wrapper around the standard WordPress search feature. While it was quicker than normal WordPress search results, it was still slower than it needed to be. There was no built-in spelling correction. Searched terms were not highlighted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new system uses the same sync technology behind Jetpack features like Related Posts, Publicize, and Stats to cache content. It then builds a search index using the Elasticsearch engine from the cache.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team has built an optimized API, which now supports searching as the user types and uses pageview stats as part of the algorithm in result rankings. Search input also goes directly from the browser to the API on WordPress.com, which minimizes the delay in returning results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;All search engines work by preprocessing the data to ensure that when a user&rsquo;s search query comes in the results can quickly be returned,&rdquo; said Brown. &ldquo;For Jetpack Search, very little of the processing time on our servers goes to processing the queries. Almost all of the server load comes from indexing the data and reindexing it as the content changes. Across our main search cluster, for instance, only 10% of the CPU time is spent processing about 850 search queries per second. Most of the time is spent on the 650 index operations per second.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown explains this new architecture is why the new pricing tiers are based on the number of records cached from a site. &ldquo;We preprocess the data, which expands how big it is; store it on the fastest SSDs we can buy; replicate it to multiple data centers; and then can quickly serve results as soon as a search request comes to our API.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For readers who are interested in a more technical breakdown of the system, Brown has written a full overview titled <a

class=\"has-drop-cap\">Denis &#381;oljom, the automation representative for the WordPress theme review team, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2020/04/03/proposal-github-theme-review/\">proposed moving much of the theme review system</a> over to GitHub. The idea is to move the interactive parts of the review away from the current system. The proposal claims such a move would streamline the process via automated tools and make the manual, reviewer-to-author interactions easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the theme review process takes place on <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/\">Trac</a>. For many theme authors and reviewers, the software can feel archaic. It does not have the feature set that developers have become accustomed to with other solutions. With the move of major parts of WordPress, such as feature plugin development, to GitHub over the past few years, it might be time to reevaluate other areas of the core project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#381;oljom noted in the proposal that reviews handled through Trac are cumbersome. As a former theme review team lead and reviewer, I know how many on the team feel. Right now, much of the review process is manual. It is handled via a lot of back-and-forth communication between the reviewer and author. There is no good way to leave a note or comment on a specific line of code when there is an issue. This ongoing <em>discussion</em> between reviewer and author is sometimes hindered by a language barrier. The experience of comparing changes between code updates is lackluster at best. Plus, the only automated check is handled by the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/\">Theme Check</a> plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Handling reviews on GitHub opens a new world of possibilities that could make reviews more efficient and provide a better experience on both ends of the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From 2015 through 2019, I ran a side business with a partner where we performed code reviews on plugins and themes. The majority of that business was working with commercial theme shops. Around 90% of the reviews were handled on GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, I was still volunteering with the WordPress theme review team. There was no comparison in terms of user experience. GitHub won hands down. This experience turned me away from wanting to perform reviews for the official directory. Nothing there was streamlined. It was tougher to point to specific code issues and check if a problem was corrected when an author sent in an update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#381;oljom&rsquo;s initial proposal outlines a system where the theme author submits their theme through the WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/\">theme upload page</a>. If it passes the initial check, the system would automatically create a new GitHub repository with the theme. Theme authors can then fork this newly-created repository to work on code changes based on reviewer feedback. Theme updates would also work through GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think that forks are a good middle ground,&rdquo; said &#381;oljom. &ldquo;Authors have forks on their own GitHub accounts and can update those, and make updates that way even. That would definitely help us with people who are trying to trick the system by updating their themes once they go live with things that break the requirements.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal is merely an idea to explore at this stage. Much of the process could change if it is given the green light to proceed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;In the end, I hope this initiative will go live and help us bring the review queue down,&rdquo; said &#381;oljom. He has hopes the team can integrate more automated checks such as the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards\">WordPress Coding Standards</a>. With more automation, it could also mean the theme review team could focus on other projects it works on, such as preparing for the future of full-site editing and continuing education.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Beyond the Review Process</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">One of the primary issues the team has faced over the years is educating authors on writing cleaner and more secure code. Some issues like sanitizing data on input and escaping it on output are still prevalent during reviews. The team&rsquo;s history of communication via Trac has not seemed to help with education on the whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The main point is the fact that many people can be involved in the review process, and then you have experienced reviewers who can show why some code is not good or needs improvement,&rdquo; said &#381;oljom. &ldquo;This provides a way for many people to see what is wrong with the code and how they can improve it. Plus the forked theme stays in their repo, so they can see the changes that they made and why.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#381;oljom has a few items in reserve for the long-term wish list. One possibility for the future may be setting up themes on Packagist for installation via Composer. He admits that it is a longshot at best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I see this as an opportunity to bring one aspect of WordPress up to par with other modern PHP frameworks like Laravel,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Plus, utilize automatic tools at our disposal. From PHP CodeSniffer, PHPStan, ES Lint, and a plethora of other tools, we could also show authors how they can set these tools on their projects and make their coding skills better. Maybe throw some automatic integration tests in the mix. The possibilities are really endless.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 06 Apr 2020 20:08:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Proposal to Add a Consent API to WordPress, Feature Plugin Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=98269\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:199:\"https://wptavern.com/proposal-to-add-a-consent-api-to-wordpress-feature-plugin-available?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=proposal-to-add-a-consent-api-to-wordpress-feature-plugin-available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4432:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">On Wednesday, Garret Hyder announced a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/04/01/feature-plugin-proposal-wp-consent-api/\">feature proposal for a WordPress Consent API.</a> The proposal is one step on the larger <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/roadmap/privacy/\">privacy roadmap</a> for core. If merged into WordPress, it would establish a standard method for core, plugins, and themes to obtain consent for various privacy-related features. The idea is to create a consistent experience for developers, site administrators, and site visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-consent-api/\">WP Consent API</a> plugin is available via the WordPress plugin directory. Development is currently happening on the plugin&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://github.com/rlankhorst/wp-consent-level-api/\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyder identified several areas in which an API for handling consent could help in bringing a site into compliance with various privacy laws:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Consent management plugins cannot prevent other plugins from placing a PHP cookie.</li><li>Plugins that integrate tracking code on the client-side could break the site if blocked by a consent management plugin.</li><li>Minified URLs in JavaScript files may not be detected by automatic blocking scripts.</li><li>Using a blocking approach to handle privacy requires a list of all types of URLs when dealing with cookies and other types of tracking.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Primarily this API is aimed at helping to achieve a compliant use of cookies or other means of tracking by WordPress websites,&rdquo; wrote Hyder in the proposal. &ldquo;If a plugin or custom code triggers, for example, Facebook, usage of this API will be of help to ensure consent. If a user manually embeds a Facebook iframe, a cookie blocker is needed that initially disables the iframe and or scripts.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is not to create functionality that would block third-party scripts, such as tracking from a site like Facebook. Because different jurisdictions have their own laws across the world, the actual management of blocking functionality would be best suited for a consent management plugin. This would be outside of the scope of what WordPress does out of the box. By providing an API directly in core, it would allow plugin developers to build consent management plugins that are needed in different locations. The API would merely be a means for all plugins to <em>talk the same language</em>. That standardization would allow consent management plugins to work as they should.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, adding a front-end user interface would place additional scripts, styles, and functionality on all WordPress sites. These types are things are best handled by plugin developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The API proposes allowing the creation of consent categories. Such categories might be preferences, marketing, or statistics. They would be filterable by plugins. The API has two indicators to determine consent for a category: a region-based consent type, which can be opt-in or opt-out, and the visitor&rsquo;s choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team working on the project has put together a <a href=\"https://wpconsentapi.org/\">Consent API Demo</a> to see how this plugin would work along with consent management on a website&rsquo;s front end. The demo makes use of the <a href=\"https://complianz.io/\">Complianz plugin</a> and an <a href=\"https://github.com/rlankhorst/consent-api-example-plugin\">example plugin</a> for showcasing how the API works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consent management is a tough area to handle in terms of web design and development. On the one hand, respecting the privacy laws of various jurisdictions is necessary for many people around the world. On the other hand, cookie notice popups on websites often create a poor user experience for site visitors, and that experience may only get worse before it gets better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a standard API is past due in core WordPress. This will at least provide plugin authors with a means of working with consent management plugins. In time, maybe we will find a front-end interface that creates a nice experience while maintaining privacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team is currently looking for feedback on the proposal and plugin. If the feature proposal is accepted, authors of consent management plugins should be prepared to begin integrating with the API.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 03 Apr 2020 19:25:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WordPress.org blog: The Month in WordPress: March 2020\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=8532\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/04/the-month-in-wordpress-march-2020/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8586:\"<p>The month of March was both a tough and exciting time for the WordPress open-source project.

For regular Tavern readers, I may sound like a broken record at this point, but I am going to continue evangelizing this upcoming feature for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no social plans or other important things requiring my attention this past weekend, it made for a good moment to dip my toes back into the development waters. I have not built a new plugin for public release since becoming a writer for WP Tavern six months ago. My excitement over block patterns was creating an itch that I needed to scratch. Combine that with the physical distancing we are all practicing during the current worldwide pandemic, it made for an opportune moment to throw together a plugin idea I had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me introduce you to Block Pattern Builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the initial API launched for <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-7-8-adds-patterns-api-and-continues-interface-cleanup\">block patterns in Gutenberg 7.8</a>, it was immediately apparent how easy registering custom patterns would be for theme and plugin authors. Building a pattern was as simple as creating a unique ID, giving it a title, and pasting in the code for the blocks that make up the pattern. There is almost no coding actually involved with building patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because patterns are merely the HTML code from blocks, it meant that it was possible to utilize the block editor to create them. End-users could do this. They just need an easy way to publish their custom patterns. That&rsquo;s where the Block Pattern Builder plugin comes in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the idea in mind, I knocked out a working prototype in an hour on Saturday afternoon. I have since cleaned the code a bit and packaged it for you all to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Download the plugin:</strong>  You can <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-pattern-builder\">grab the plugin</a> from the WordPress plugin directory or install it directly from the new plugin screen in your admin. It is also <a href=\"https://github.com/justintadlock/block-pattern-builder\">available via GitHub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Block Pattern Builder Works</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Block Pattern Builder requires version 7.8 or later of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg\">Gutenberg plugin</a> to work. Eventually, perhaps in WordPress 5.5, the block pattern system will be merged directly into WordPress. For now, the latest version of the Gutenberg plugin is necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After installing and activating the plugin, it adds a new admin menu item titled &ldquo;Block Patterns.&rdquo; From that point, creating patterns works just like creating a post or page. You simply add a new pattern by clicking the &ldquo;Add New&rdquo; link. You can rearrange blocks to your heart&rsquo;s desire. When you have a pattern that you like, publish it.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Creating a custom block pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>Once a pattern is published, it is available via the pattern sidebar in the block editor. Currently, this is a button in the top right corner of the editor. However, its location and interface are likely to change as the Gutenberg team continues developing the feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting a block pattern into the post editor.\n\n\n\n<p>That is all there is to it. It is a simple system, but it will provide an easy way to play around with the patterns feature in Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Notes and Ideas</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Because block patterns are an evolving feature in the Gutenberg plugin, the system could break until things are a bit more settled down. The underlying API could change. However, that does not mean we cannot have a little fun in the meantime. Just keep in mind this is currently flagged as an experimental feature in Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a plugin or theme author who wants to register your patterns within your own plugins or themes, you can make use of this plugin too. Build your custom patterns within the provided editor. Then, switch over to the code view for the block editor. You can copy the block code and register it via the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/block-api/block-patterns/\">Patterns API</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need inspiration for patterns, Gutenberg Hub&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://templates.gutenberghub.com/\">template library</a> has over 100 ideas to choose from. You can copy and paste those directly into the editor and save them as custom patterns with Block Pattern Builder.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 02 Apr 2020 20:03:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: BuddyPress 6.0 Beta Introduces Group and Member Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=98219\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:173:\"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-6-0-beta-introduces-group-and-member-blocks?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=buddypress-6-0-beta-introduces-group-and-member-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5461:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The team behind <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/\">BuddyPress</a> dropped the first <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2020/03/buddypress-6-0-0-beta1/\">version 6.0 beta release</a> of the plugin yesterday. One of the most important features is the introduction of the new member and group blocks for the WordPress editor. The plugin now requires at least PHP 5.6 and WordPress 4.8 (5.0 to use the new blocks).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s exciting times,&rdquo; said John James Jacoby, lead developer of BuddyPress, on the addition of the new blocks. &ldquo;Having things as blocks means end-users gain a bit more freedom with where and how they integrate BuddyPress into their existing sites. Right now, BuddyPress blocks are mostly presentational &mdash; quick ways to output stuff from the community anywhere blocks are allowed. In a few years, when blocks have matured and are the de-facto way to interact with everything, I can imagine there being a single BuddyPress block that wraps the entire functionality of the community into a single block like its own little web applet.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BuddyPress 6.0 is scheduled for launch at the end of April. End-users can test the latest version of the plugin via the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-beta-tester/\">BP Beta Tester</a> or by directly downloading the <a href=\"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/buddypress.6.0.0-beta1.zip\">beta ZIP file</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the new blocks, the <a href=\"https://developer.buddypress.org/bp-rest-api/\">BP REST API</a> is now complete, which provides developers with a more robust tool to build apps. The user profile photo and cover image fields have also been moved to the Members component of the plugin. This change allows end-users to use the features without activating the BP Extended Profile component.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Introducing the Member and Group Blocks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Version 6.0 of BuddyPress will include only two blocks. However, there are plans to add more over time. The development of blocks takes place in the <a href=\"https://github.com/buddypress/bp-blocks\">BP Blocks repository</a> on GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BuddyPress 6.0 will create a new &ldquo;BuddyPress&rdquo; category in the block inserter. This houses the current blocks and will contain those created in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The member block is a simple member profile box that displays the member avatar, cover image, display name, and username. At the bottom of the block, it adds a button to view the member&rsquo;s profile. Each of the fields can be enabled or disabled via the block settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />BuddyPress member block.\n\n\n\n<p>The group block works similarly to the member block. The group avatar, cover image, name, and description are all shown by default. Visibility options are also available via the block settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />BuddyPress group block.\n\n\n\n<p>The only trivial gripe I have with the new blocks is how the block settings are handled. Each setting is placed within its own tabbed section. It does not make sense to open or close four tabs to get to a single setting for each. The team may add extra settings under each tab in the future, but it currently feels like unnecessary mouse clicks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the team has put together a nice update and the blocks worked without issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Future BuddyPress Blocks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Development of BuddyPress blocks <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2019/11/the-road-to-buddypress-blocks/\">began in November 2019</a>. The team garnered 161 votes in a poll on which blocks to build. The initial work started based on that feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We think working on blocks to highlight a single Group or a single Member is a good starting point,&rdquo; wrote Mathieu Viet, BuddyPress developer. It made sense to implement simpler blocks for the team&rsquo;s first foray into block development. It will be a large undertaking that will take many months of development hours to build into the block system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team has plans for the future but is looking forward to hearing feedback. &ldquo;We are very open to ideas into this area,&rdquo; said Viet. &ldquo;So the obvious next blocks are transforming our existing widgets into blocks. We are also working on a new <a href=\"https://github.com/buddypress/bp-attachments\">Media component</a>, which should include a block to select user-generated media from the block editor.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Viet said he had at least one &ldquo;crazy idea&rdquo; in mind but hasn&rsquo;t discussed it much with the team yet. &ldquo;Bring a light version of the block editor into the front end to replace the textarea we are using to post activities,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some BP block types like the User Media one would then be available to post richer activity content using a simple property like <em>supports activity</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Launching the block editor on the front end, even a light version, could be interesting. It may be the future for plugins like BuddyPress that rely on solid front-end posting solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the near-term future, Viet said the team is looking for contributors to the <a href=\"https://github.com/buddypress/bp-blocks\">BP Blocks repository</a>. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be very happy to include their work into BP Core if we believe our community members would be interested in these blocks,&rdquo; he said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 01 Apr 2020 19:28:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"HeroPress: How WordPress enabled me to take care of my baby without compromising on my career goals\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=3083\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:250:\"https://heropress.com/essays/how-wordpress-enabled-me-to-take-care-of-my-baby-without-compromising-on-my-career-goals/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-wordpress-enabled-me-to-take-care-of-my-baby-without-compromising-on-my-career-goals\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6080:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/032720-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: Remote jobs seem to be very promising & advantageous for women, especially for moms.\" /><p>Hello everyone! <img class=\"emoji\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/svg/1f44b.svg\" alt=\"&#x1f44b;\" /></p>\n<p>Since my <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/joy-giving-back/\">first essay </a>on HeroPress, there have been many changes in my life.

What else can a mother desire?</p>\n<p>Remote jobs seem to be very promising and advantageous for women, especially for moms. Mothers no longer need to worry about leaving their little ones at home. I, as a mother, am very thankful to WordPress</p>\n<p>BTW, rtCamp is always hiring!

development</strong>, so we recommend running this beta release on a <strong>testing site</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test BuddyPress 6.0.0-beta1 in 4 ways :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Try the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-beta-tester/\">BP Beta Tester</a> plugin.</li><li><a href=\"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/buddypress.6.0.0-beta1.zip\">Download the beta here (zip

there!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for bugs is an important part of polishing the release during the beta stage and a great way to contribute. Here are some of the big changes and features to pay close attention to while testing (Check out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&group=resolution&milestone=6.0.0\">this report</a>&nbsp;on Trac for the full list).</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>User Profile Photo &amp; User Cover Image are now belonging to the BP Members component.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the very first version of BuddyPress, the local avatar management feature (renamed as <em>Profile Photo</em> in version 2.1) was depending on the BP Extended Profile component. When we introduced the Cover Image feature in version 2.4, we&#8217;ve also made it dependent of the BP Extended Profile component. <strong>In 6.0.0, both features has been moved to the BP Members component</strong>. It means they will always be available even if the BP Extended Profile component is not active on your setup. We recommend you to <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2020/03/01/the-profile-photo-cover-image-features-belong-to-members/\">read this development note</a> to learn what this move changes for end users and for BuddyPress plugin/theme developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>The BP REST API is now completed!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 5.0.0, we&#8217;ve introduced the first endpoints and a <a href=\"https://developer.buddypress.org/bp-rest-api/\">reference documentation about them</a>. In 6.0.0, we are adding the remaining ones so that you can build great BuddyPress full featured apps!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PS:  we will update the reference documentation with these new endpoints during this beta stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>The first BuddyPress Blocks are arriving <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 6.0.0, you will be able to feature a specific member or a specific group of your community site into your posts or pages: discover more information about the BP Member Block and the BP Group Block reading <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2020/03/30/welcome-to-the-first-buddypress-blocks/\">this development note</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>New PHP and WordPress required versions.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>BuddyPress 6.0.0 is requiring <strong>PHP &gt;= 5.6</strong> and <strong>WordPress &gt;= 4.8</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How You Can Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/buddypress/dev/\">Help us translate BuddyPress into more than 100 languages</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think you’ve found a bug, you can post in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://buddypress.org/support\">the support forums</a>.

A slew of features were developed in the past several months. This release will include features from Gutenberg 6.6 through 7.5. Bug fixes from more recent versions of the plugin are also included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The development team refined the user experience with updates such as making it easier to select multiple blocks and pinning the toolbar to the top of the screen on mobile devices. They introduced a Welcome Guide modal to familiarize end-users with the block editor. Block breadcrumbs are easier to navigate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest user-facing change is that the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/editor-will-default-to-fullscreen-mode-in-wordpress-5-4\">block editor now defaults to fullscreen mode</a>. Users who do not prefer fullscreen mode can revert this change by clicking the tools and options button (vertical ellipsis icon) and uncheck the &ldquo;Fullscreen mode&rdquo; option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has added a gradient background feature to the button and cover blocks. Users can change the color of individual bits of text within all rich text fields (e.g., paragraphs, lists). Plus, the featured image box supports dragging and dropping an image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor has two new blocks: social icons and buttons. The social icons block allows users to add a group of linked icons to their social networks. This feature will become more useful once WordPress moves to full-site editing in the future. For now, usage may be limited by being able to place them only in post or page content. The buttons block lets end-users create a group of buttons. The existing button block is allowed only within the buttons block now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a few exceptions, WP Tavern has covered every major release of the Gutenberg plugin that will be included in this WordPress update.

For a full overview, see our coverage of the most important code changes in our <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/preparing-for-wordpress-5-4-changes-theme-and-plugin-developers-should-know-about\">version 5.4 developer preparation post</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors now have access to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/03/02/new-gradient-theme-apis/\">Gradients API</a> for the cover and button blocks. They should also make sure their theme block styles handle the new social icons and buttons blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some breaking changes that theme authors may need to account for. Several CSS classes have been <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/03/02/markup-and-style-related-changes/\">renamed within the block editor</a>. The core team also rewrote the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/02/12/changes-related-to-calendar-widget-markup-in-wordpress-5-4/\">HTML markup for the calendar widget</a> and updated its classes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block developers can now use the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/02/27/block-collections/\">Collections API</a> to group collections of blocks by namespace. The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/02/27/introduce-block-variations-api/\">Variations API</a> allows developers to create variations of an individual block. The new social icons block makes good use of this API to create variations for each of the social icons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugin and theme authors have new hooks for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/02/25/wordpress-5-4-introduces-new-hooks-to-add-custom-fields-to-menu-items/\">adding custom fields to nav menus</a>.

More efficient processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And more speed everywhere, so as you build sections or galleries, or just type in a line of prose, you can feel how much faster your work flows.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/Squares.jpg?resize=632%2C316&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8480\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Two new blocks. And better blocks overall.</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Two brand-new blocks: Social Icons and Buttons make adding interactive features fast and easy.</li><li>New ways with color: Gradients in the Buttons and Cover block, toolbar access to color options in Rich Text blocks, and for the first time, color options in the Group and Columns blocks.</li><li>Guess a whole lot less! Version 5.4 streamlines the whole process for placing and replacing multimedia in every block. Now it works the same way in almost every block!</li><li>And if you’ve ever thought your image in the Media+Text block should link to something else—perhaps a picture of a brochure should download that brochure as a document? Well, now it can.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cleaner UI, clearer navigation—and easier tabbing!</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Clearer block navigation with block breadcrumbs. And easier selection once you get there.</li><li>For when you need to navigate with the keyboard, better tabbing and focus. Plus, you can tab over to the sidebar of nearly any block.</li><li>Speed! 14% faster loading of the editor, 51% faster time-to-type!</li><li>Tips are gone. In their place, a Welcome Guide window you can bring up when you need it—and only when you need it—again and again.</li><li>Know at a glance whether you’re in a block’s Edit or Navigation mode. Or, if you have restricted vision, your screen reader will tell you which mode you’re in.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\">Of course, if you want to work with the very latest tools and features, <strong><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">install the Gutenberg plugin</a></strong>. You’ll get to be the first to use new and exciting features in the block editor before anyone else has seen them!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/Rectangles-and-circles.jpg?resize=632%2C316&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8481\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Your fundamental right: privacy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>5.4 helps with a variety of privacy issues around the world. So when users and stakeholders ask about regulatory compliance, or how your team handles user data, the answers should be a lot easier to get right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Now personal data exports include users session information and users location data from the community events widget. Plus, a table of contents!</li><li>See progress as you process export and erasure requests through the privacy tools.</li><li>Plus, little enhancements throughout give the privacy tools a little cleaner look. Your eyes will thank you!</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/Mixed.jpg?resize=632%2C316&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8482\" />\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Just for developers</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Add custom fields to menu items—natively</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Two new actions let you add custom fields to menu items—without a plugin and without writing custom walkers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the Menus admin screen, <code>wp_nav_menu_item_custom_fields</code> fires just before the move buttons of a nav menu item in the menu editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Customizer, <code>wp_nav_menu_item_custom_fields_customize_template</code> fires at the end of the menu-items form-fields template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check your code and see where these new actions can replace your custom code, and if you’re concerned about duplication, add a check for the WordPress version.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Blocks! Simpler styling, new APIs and embeds</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Radically simpler block styling. Negative margins and default padding are gone! Now you can style blocks the way you need them. And, a refactor got rid of four redundant wrapper divs.</li><li>If you build plugins, now you can register collections of your blocks by namespace across categories—a great way to get more brand visibility.</li><li>Let users do more with two new APIs: block variations and gradients.</li><li>In embeds, now the block editor supports TikTok—and CollegeHumor is gone.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\">There’s lots more for developers to love in WordPress 5.4.

If you are a PHP programmer and have had the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/lessons-learned-by-stepping-outside-wordpress-comfort-zone\">opportunity to work outside of WordPress</a> in the past 10 years, there are likely one or two or a few dozen things that frustrate you when diving back into the project&rsquo;s 16-year-old codebase. At a time when WordPress is gifting JavaScript programmers with the latest and greatest goodies, those doing PHP work can feel left behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a good reason for the legacy code in WordPress: it is backward compatible with over a decade of third-party extensions. Plus, <em>old</em> code does not necessarily equate to <em>bad</em> code. <em>If it ain&rsquo;t broke</em> &mdash; well, you know how the rest goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, WordPress <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-ends-support-for-php-5-2-5-5-bumps-minimum-required-php-version-to-5-6\">bumped the minimum requirement</a> for running the software to PHP 5.6 or newer. Many developers cheered in support of features such as short array syntax, namespacing, and the spread operator. Others wanted to jump to PHP 7+, but PHP 5.6 was a good stepping stone to more modern PHP code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This change opened some new questions. <em>When will core WordPress begin using new features? What coding standards should the project follow?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.3 made use of the new <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/coming-in-wordpress-5-3-what-is-the-php-spread-operator\">spread operator</a>, which cleaned up and simplified several functions. It showed a willingness of the core leads to update some outdated code while avoiding backward-compatible issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>An Updated Set of Standards</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">To begin using modern PHP features in WordPress, the platform&rsquo;s coding standards must evolve. On March 20, Juliette Reinders Folmer <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/03/20/updating-the-coding-standards-for-modern-php/\">proposed an extensive set of guidelines</a>. The proposal is a draft and will need to be fine-tuned based on feedback from developers and core contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;While it may still be a while before some of these features will actually be adopted for use in WordPress Core,&rdquo; wrote Folmer, &ldquo;defining the coding standards in advance will allow for a consistent code base when they do get adopted and will allow for plugins and themes, which are not necessarily bound to the PHP 5.6 minimum, to safeguard their code consistency when they start using more modern PHP already.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposed standards are broken down into the following topics:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Namespace declarations</li><li>Import <code>use</code> statements</li><li>Traits and interfaces</li><li>Type declarations</li><li>Declare statements / strict typing</li><li>The <code>::class</code> constant</li><li>Operators</li><li>Additional new rules covering various items</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Any code that goes directly into WordPress must follow the project&rsquo;s coding standards. It is strongly recommended that plugin and theme developers adopt the same standards, but it is not a requirement for inclusion in the official plugin and theme directories. Coding standards across an ecosystem make it easier for one developer to pick up code from other developers without having to learn unique styles between extensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, the update look solid. There is a lot to like about this proposal, and it would be a welcome addition to a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/\">set of guidelines</a> that sorely needed a refresh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my biggest gripes is around file naming. The WordPress project should drop the use of <code>class-</code>, <code>interface-</code>, and <code>trait-</code> prefixes from PHP filenames. Instead, we should use this opportunity to adopt the <a href=\"https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/\">PSR-4 autoloading standard&rsquo;s</a> naming convention. In that standard, the filename matches the class, interface, or trait&rsquo;s name exactly. At the very least, the prefixed filenames should not be a recommendation that goes out to WordPress developers everywhere. Keep it for core if necessary for tradition, but don&rsquo;t recommend widespread usage of a system that is years out of touch with modern PHP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would also like to see WordPress adopt the use of Pascal case (i.e., <code>ExampleProject</code>) over camel caps (i.e., <code>Example_Project</code>) for namespaces. However, given the tradition of camel caps for class names, I do not see this changing. This is a bit nit-picky, but it feels out of place in comparison to other, more modern PHP projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest thing the WordPress developer community can do right now is to discuss the proposal and offer feedback. Most of the work is done. It is up to the community to help push it forward.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 19:48:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.4 RC5\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=8451\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/03/wordpress-5-4-rc5/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2181:\"<p><br />The fifth release candidate for WordPress 5.4 is live!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.4 is currently scheduled to land on&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-4/\">March 31 2020</a></strong>, and we need&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;help to get there—if you haven’t tried 5.4 yet, now is the time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test the WordPress 5.4 release candidate in two ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Try the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (choose the “bleeding edge nightlies” option)</li><li>Or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.4-RC5.zip\">download the release candidate here</a> (zip).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For details about what to expect in WordPress 5.4, please see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/03/wordpress-5-4-release-candidate/\">first release candidate post</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Plugin and Theme Developers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Please test your plugins and themes against WordPress 5.4 and update the&nbsp;<em>Tested up to</em>&nbsp;version in the readme to 5.4.

The solid icons available in the Font Awesome 5.13 update are all available for free and are open-source. The regular, light, and duotone versions of the icons are a part of the pro package.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal of the new icons is to help websites and apps boost awareness around the global pandemic. The latest update adds 47 new icons that range from medical use to promoting hygienic practices such as hand washing. Some icons represent viruses and social/physical distancing. There is even a couple of toilet paper icons thrown in for good measure. <em>Apparently, those are necessary in today&rsquo;s world of mass panic buying.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Based on recommendations from The World Health Organization and others, you&rsquo;ll find symbols to communicate good hygiene and social distancing,&rdquo; wrote Jory Raphael, Icon Design Lead at Font Awesome. &ldquo;While we can&rsquo;t be on the front lines like brave medical professionals across the globe, we hope these icons aid in communicating some of the most important things people can do to protect themselves and their communities.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The icons were <a href=\"https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/16315\">originally requested</a> two weeks ago on the Font Awesome GitHub repository. The design team moved quickly to make them available. There are additional icon tickets for <a href=\"https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/13931\">liquid soap</a> and a <a href=\"https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/15855\">bar of soap</a> open.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all Font Awesome icons, the new icons are available as part of the font package or for download as individual SVG files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fonts may come in handy for website owners, designers, and developers who are building sites or pages with content related to COVID-19. Icons can add context to content or focus attention where needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/font-awesome/\">Font Awesome WordPress plugin</a> should have immediate access to the new icons if needed. The plugin relies on the external Font Awesome CDN or Font Awesome kits. Users can also choose which version of the library of icons they wish to use, which includes the latest release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background has-gray-100-background-color is-style-highlight bg-gray-100\">If you know of any other icon sets or resources for designers and developers related to COVID-19, please share them in the comments.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 20:00:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 7.8 Adds Patterns API and Continues Interface Cleanup\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=98109\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:191:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-7-8-adds-patterns-api-and-continues-interface-cleanup?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gutenberg-7-8-adds-patterns-api-and-continues-interface-cleanup\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5936:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Version 7.8 of the Gutenberg plugin <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/03/26/whats-new-in-gutenberg-25-march/\">landed yesterday</a>. The team continues to improve the editor with the refreshed interface work that began in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-7-7-ships-refreshed-ui-and-first-iteration-of-block-patterns\">version 7.7</a>. The most useful feature with this update of the plugin is the inclusion of the Patterns API for plugin and theme developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release is not the massive feature release that we experienced with some earlier versions. It is the culmination of many smaller improvements, particularly with improving the user interface and experience. The update includes over 20 bug fixes, some continued work on experimental features like the site editor, and several improvements in code quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/12009\">Editing a post permalink</a> without requiring a save should work correctly, which has been an outstanding issue for over a year. Users can now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/20781\">select multiple categories</a> for the latest posts block as opposed to a single category. And, the experimental full-site editing feature now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/20691\">supports fullscreen mode</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>UI Continues Improving</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Gutenberg 7.8 editor with updated preview button.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The team began a massive refresh of the user interface in Gutenberg 7.7. With this release, they continued building upon that initial work. Designers have <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/20980\">fine-tuned several of the icons</a> for the editor toolbar, which includes the bold, italic, strikethrough, indent, outdent, and spacer icons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most notable differences is an update to the user-facing text for the post preview button. In the previous version, there was a button that simply read &ldquo;Desktop.&rdquo; Once clicked, it would open a drop-down list to preview the post in desktop, tablet, or mobile mode. I had initially thought the team had removed the post preview option until I clicked on it. In version 7.8, that button&rsquo;s text now reads &ldquo;Preview,&rdquo; which is a much-needed change that is no longer confusing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the polishing work done on the editor looks good. At this point, I have become so accustomed to it that I have no desire to go back to a regular WordPress install without the Gutenberg plugin installed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Building Custom Block Patterns</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom block pattern registered and in use.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I have said it before, but it bears repeating: I am <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/block-patterns-will-change-everything\">excited about block patterns</a>. I am even more excited about the ability for plugin and theme authors to begin testing this feature by building custom patterns of their own. I foresee an explosion of creativity over the next several months and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns are a registration of the HTML for one or more blocks. Plugin and theme authors can further define the settings for those blocks. The Gutenberg team included a simple PHP function for developers to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/21074\">register custom patterns</a> called <code>register_pattern()</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have tinkered with numerous pattern ideas since I updated yesterday evening. The simplest way to build a pattern is to do so visually. Open the editor and create a unique group of blocks that you like. Then, switch to the code editor and copy the code. From that point, you can register the pattern via PHP and paste the copied code. There is not really much actual coding involved in the process. Even advanced users with enough DIY grit could register them within their theme&rsquo;s <code>functions.php</code> file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following is a simple &ldquo;hero&rdquo; pattern as shown in the above screenshot that uses the cover block, a heading, a paragraph, and a buttons group (I formatted the code a little after copying and pasting for readability):</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>add_action( \'init\', function() {\n\n	register_pattern( \'tavern/hero-1\', [\n		\'title\'   =&gt; __( \'Hero 1\' ),\n		\'content\' =&gt;\n			\'&lt;!-- wp:cover {\"customOverlayColor\":\"#273f60\",\"align\":\"full\"} --&gt;\n			&lt;div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull has-background-dim\" style=\"background-color:#273f60\"&gt;\n				&lt;div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container\"&gt;\n					&lt;!-- wp:heading {\"align\":\"center\"} --&gt;\n					&lt;h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\"&gt;Heading Title Here&lt;/h2&gt;\n					&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;\n\n					&lt;!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --&gt;\n					&lt;p class=\"has-text-align-center\"&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.&lt;/p&gt;\n					&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;\n\n					&lt;!-- wp:buttons {\"align\":\"center\"} --&gt;\n					&lt;div class=\"wp-block-buttons aligncenter\"&gt;\n						&lt;!-- wp:button {\"className\":\"is-style-outline\"} --&gt;\n						&lt;div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"wp-block-button__link\"&gt;Button A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n						&lt;!-- /wp:button --&gt;\n						&lt;!-- wp:button {\"className\":\"is-style-outline\"} --&gt;\n						&lt;div class=\"wp-block-button is-style-outline\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"wp-block-button__link\"&gt;Button B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n						&lt;!-- /wp:button --&gt;\n					&lt;/div&gt;\n					&lt;!-- /wp:buttons --&gt;\n				&lt;/div&gt;\n			&lt;/div&gt;\n			&lt;!-- /wp:cover --&gt;\'\n	] );\n} );</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background has-gray-100-background-color bg-gray-100\"><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The preceding code is for an experimental feature and could change in later versions of the Gutenberg plugin or before the API is officially added to core WordPress.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 20:06:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"WPTavern: Finding Balance in These Uncertain Times: Remote Work and Sharing Our Struggles\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=98079\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:221:\"https://wptavern.com/finding-balance-in-these-uncertain-times-remote-work-and-sharing-our-struggles?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=finding-balance-in-these-uncertain-times-remote-work-and-sharing-our-struggles\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5811:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">There is a popular saying, which has been used in several memes, among my developer and remote-working friend groups. It goes something like the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Government and Doctors:</strong> <em>Practice physical distancing during this pandemic.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Remote Workers:</strong> <em>I&rsquo;ve been preparing my whole life for this moment. I got this.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is that we don&rsquo;t &ldquo;got this,&rdquo; at least I know I don&rsquo;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While practicing physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is those little moments that you do not think you will miss that suddenly become important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every Saturday, I awake around 6 or 6:30 a.m. I go through my normal routine and get dressed for a morning drive into the city. My home is in a quiet area in rural Alabama. I am a Millennial living within a neighborhood of mostly Baby Boomers. For the most part, it is an ideal place for remote work. Few people bother me, and I can tend to my animals and get my work done in peace. However, it is not exactly the most socially invigorating place in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those Saturday mornings are important. Assuming I have no other social plans for the week, it is my one chance to get out into the world. I stop by the local Co-Op, pick up any feed or seed I need, and chat with the people there about the farming season or the weather &mdash; mostly the weather. I drop into Hidden Treasures, a flea market, and talk with a seller who shares an interest in finding old DVDs, VHS tapes, and Laserdiscs. I grab a sandwich at Subway and am greeted by the Indian-American manager who learned my name on my first visit years ago. He asks about my family. I ask how his family is doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These fleeting moments are almost forgettable. They are routine. Run-of-the-mill. When they are happening, you do not think about them. However, when they are gone, there is a void remaining that is hard to fill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I have been practicing physical distancing for over a decade, at least to some degree. That makes those small moments where I interact with others in person crucial to my mental health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Saturday, I will once again head into the city after a hiatus. However, my trip will be different. This time, I will be gathering necessities for myself and some of my elderly neighbors who want to avoid the public for a while. The trip will be quick. Some of the places I normally visit are closed. My Subway meal will be carryout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even after a couple of weeks, and feeling like I was prepared for this moment, I am still coming to grips with the world as it is now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Staying Strong as a Community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The WordPress community, the people, have put up a strong front. Bloggers have written <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/advice-for-newcomers-to-remote-work-lessons-learned\">posts on remote work</a>. Developers, designers, and others have willingly shared their knowledge with others. Companies are offering discounts to help ease the burden for those looking to begin a shop or blog online. Yes, our community will get through this, and we will be stronger for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it is OK for us to share our vulnerabilities during these uncertain times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, this community is not about software. It is about people. The software is the way we connect. It is a tool that we program, design, and evangelize. We do it for ourselves. We do it for millions of others to have a voice online. But, it is always about people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, people need to know that others in our community are struggling. This is a collective pain that we are working through. Remote work does not always mean physical distancing from everything and every one of the outside world. Many of us may have a bit of a head-start on staying put at home for hours on end, but we are also dealing with a new reality every day. Showing strength is good, but sharing our stories of struggle is just as important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some of us, that weekly trip into the city plays a vital role in our well-being. Others are dealing with children who would normally be in school or daycare. Kids can be disruptive, even when you have the best-laid plans and every hour of their day mapped out. Even for us remote workers, life is a little out of balance now. It is OK to admit that. If you are running a WordPress business, it is OK for you to provide a little more flexibility for your workers who are at home. Many of them will need it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not time to break down. It is time to find a new balance in our current environments. That may mean starting up a family board game night. It may mean making sure that you set up a video chat with those loved ones you have been too busy to call in several months. Maybe you will start taking a daily walk for better health. It might also be time to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jemjabella/status/1240283538596999170\">set up WordPress blogs for your children</a> as part of their education. Some of these new things may and probably should become routine, <em>especially that last one</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do not become overwhelmed if you feel like you should be handling this situation better because you have practice at remote work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hop over to your personal WordPress blog. You may have to dust that thing off; some of you have not used it in a while. Write about the things you are struggling with. Share them with the community and find support among others. Post about your experiences. Tell us about your tough days and those small wins that are helping you get through this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, it is having my dad call to check in for the third time this week, and it is only Wednesday.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 18:45:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"Matt: Don’t Mute, Get a Better Headset\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=51030\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://ma.tt/2020/03/dont-mute-get-a-better-headset/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11250:\"<p>One heterodox recommendation I have for audio and video calls when you&#8217;re working in a distributed fashion is <strong>not to mute</strong>, if you can help it. When you&#8217;re speaking to a muted room, it&#8217;s eerie and unnatural —&nbsp;you feel alone even if you can see other people&#8217;s faces. You lose all of those spontaneous reactions that keep a conversation flowing. If you ask someone a question, or they want to jump in, they have to wait to unmute. I also don&#8217;t love the &#8220;unmute to raise your hand&#8221; behavior, as it lends itself to meetings where people are just waiting their turn to speak instead of truly listening. I&#8217;m always hesitant <a href=\"https://seths.blog/2018/09/how-to-be-on-a-zoom-or-skype-call-the-secrets-of-video-conferences/\">to disagree with Seth Godin</a>, but that&#8217;s been my experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what should you do? Use the latest and greatest hardware and software to have the best of both worlds, a fantastic auditory experience for you and your interlocutors and little to no background noise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarize, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=sennheiser+usb-c+headset&tag=photomatt08-20\">I recommend a wired, USB headset with a mic that stays a constant distant from your mouth and has a noise-canceling microphone</a>. Save mute for coughs and sips of drinks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of this post I&#8217;m going to try out eleven different microphones and headsets, ranging from $35 to $1,000+, and record a short file on each, and intersperse some software tips for people on MacOS.        You may want to listen to these samples with good headphones on to really hear the differences. I apologize some are louder than others, I didn&#8217;t edit to even out the levels, which Zoom or Skype would do automatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My previous top recommendation was the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D4LBOV6/?tag=photomatt08-20\">trusty Sennheiser SC 30</a>, in <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2018/10/whats-in-my-bag-2018-edition/\">my previous bag posts</a>. It&#8217;s cheap and effective, but the cord was too long and it was USB-A. If you read no further, get this one and revolutionize how you sound on Zoom calls. Here&#8217;s how it sounds:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-top\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top\">\n<img />\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P68C7Y7/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Sennheiser has upgraded to a USB-C version, with a much shorter cord, the SC 130</a>. It feels and looks much better, you don&#8217;t need a USB-C dongle, and the sound quality of the earphones is quite bearable. The cost is about twice as much (~$70).</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<img />\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can plug the USB-C into your iPad or Android phone as well and it works great, though the headphones can be a bit quiet on Android. Either of the above will spoil you for making calls, and you won&#8217;t want to go back to the old low-fi way of doing things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to have a bit more flexibility I tried out the much more expensive ($134) <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MPX2P0I/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Sennheiser MB Pro 1</a>. I liked the freedom of wireless Bluetooth, but you can hear that the sound is much worse. Connecting over Bluetooth lowers the quality a ton, and also occasionally means you need to disconnect, reconnect, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<img />\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>All three of the Sennheisers above come in two-ear versions, which I prefer if I&#8217;m in a noisy environment, but at home I find the one-ear a bit more comfortable. I got excited about this $70 <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081Q5RCMV/?tag=photomatt08-20\">TaoTronics &#8220;Trucker Bluetooth&#8221; headset because it had Bluetooth 5.0</a> so I foolishly assumed it would have better quality, but it sounds really terrible:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<img />\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>But does wireless have to mean terrible quality? The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Apple Airpods Pro ($249) are actually pretty decent</a>, and you can easily switch them between your phone and your computer in the audio menu. If you haven&#8217;t tried the Pro version, the noise canceling is actually pretty amazing for something so small and light —&nbsp;I jog with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<img />\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the best sounding mics in this entire roundup was the wireless $119 <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KQF165L?tag=photomatt08-20\">Antlion Audio ModMic Wireless</a>, which sound amazing, but you have to provide your own headphones to attach it to, and the entire thing ends up being fairly bulky and has its own wireless adapter. On the plus side, you can bring your own super-fancy headphones and get amazing audio quality. With certain headphones it did cause a buzz in the ear of the headphone I attached it to.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<img />\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>But hot dang that sounds good. If they made an over-the-ear USB-C version with an earbud, and had the mic be a little smaller, it would be work-from-home nirvana.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ventured into the gaming headset territory for this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HSC3WWL/?tag=photomatt08-20\">SteelSeries Arctis Pro Wireless Gaming Headset</a>, which at first felt totally ridiculous with its own connector box, a million cables, etc, but goshdarnit grew on me. It has this really cool boom mic   that extends out, and I think it&#8217;s the most comfortable headset I&#8217;ve worn for an extended amount of time. I tried it out via its proprietary 2.4ghz wireless connection + USB, and Bluetooth, and unfortunately the results weren&#8217;t great, including the Bluetooth being a little garbled. I hope Steelseries does another iteration because they&#8217;re <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1242668323466350592\">so close</a>, it just needs to be USB-C on the headphones, the cables, the everything, and super high quality recording.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<img />\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>One final entrant —&nbsp;how about just your laptop? Normally I would say this sounds terrible and judge people who didn&#8217;t use a headset, but <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2019/11/16-inch_macbook_pro_first_impressions\">John Gruber&#8217;s review of the new Macbook 16 had some really impressive audio files that intrigued me</a>, so here it is, the Macbook Pro 16&#8243;, which starts at about $2,400. It&#8217;s a little boomy, but not bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<img />\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay now let&#8217;s get a little crazy. Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KCXMBES/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Zoom H5</a> with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GXMTZE6/?tag=photomatt08-20\">SGH6 shotgun mic attachment</a>. (The other Zoom! $410 total.)</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<img />\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002E4Z8M/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Shure SM7B Cardioid Dynamic</a>, which is what I usually use to record the <a href=\"http://distributed.blog\">Distributed</a> podcast, and costs about $400. This is milky and smooth. (I accidentally called it a Sennheiser in the recording.)</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<img />\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>A favorite <a href=\"https://tomdheere.com/voiceovers-and-my-sennheiser-416-the-not-silent-blog-52416/\">of voiceover artists everywhere</a> is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00030679K/?tag=photomatt08-20\">Sennheiser MKH416 Super-Cardioid Shotgun Tube Condenser ($1,000)</a>, which I like the sound of and I also use for if I&#8217;m doing a fancy video setup and want super-good sound that&#8217;s not in the frame of the camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<img />\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a great sound, but the part of the house where I recorded all of these is pretty noisy with an AC unit on the other side of the wall, and there&#8217;s a ton of background noise in this.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Software eats the audio world</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like photography has been completely transformed by software enhancing images to the point where the top-of-the-line Apple or Samsung smartphone camera is better than all but the very top pro SLR cameras, I think the same thing is going to happen for audio. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of these clips are processed, which is why some of the volume levels are different, but I thought it would be fun to demo a tool I&#8217;ve been recommending to a lot of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://krisp.ai/\">$40/year program called Krisp.ai</a>, which I first learned about in 2018 from this awesome post on the <a href=\"https://devblogs.nvidia.com/nvidia-real-time-noise-suppression-deep-learning/\">Nvidia developer blog, Real-Time Noise Suppression Using Deep Learning</a>. What it does is create a virtual microphone, like a filter that exists between one of your physical inputs and what the software on your computer &#8220;hears.&#8221; For fun I re-recorded the MKH416 in the exact same place, but filtered through Krisp.ai:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns are-vertically-aligned-top\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top\">\n<img />\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the audio quality is not as good, it sounds a bit clipped, but throughout there is no more distracting background hums or noise. Krisp can be a little awkward to use but they&#8217;ve made it a lot more user friendly. You could mix Krisp with almost any option here and it would make it sound much better, in fact when I&#8217;m in a pinch my favorite go-to is Airpods Pro + Krisp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With everything, a pro tip on MacOS is to hold Option when you click on the sound icon in your upper right taskbar, and it will let you select both input and output devices.

The course is available to anyone by signing up for Yoast Academy, which also includes multiple other free and paid courses. Users can learn everything from SEO and copy writing to basic WordPress skills. The Academy team&rsquo;s latest course promises to get first-time users up to speed on using the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;At Yoast, we are huge fans of the block editor,&rdquo; wrote Marieke van de Rakt, CEO of Yoast in the <a href=\"https://yoast.com/new-free-online-training-block-editor-training/\">training course announcement</a>. &ldquo;Admittedly -not right from the start-, but we&rsquo;re now block-editor fanboys and fangirls. That&rsquo;s why we created an awesome free block editor course! We hope it will help everybody to use the block editor to the fullest!&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the course on block editor training has at least two or three hours of content to work through, depending on how quickly users digest the content. The course offers three major sections:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What is the block editor?</li><li>Using the block editor</li><li>Extras</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of these is further broken down between one and three sub-sections. At the moment, there are seven lessons in total, which range between 7 and 49 minutes based on Yoast&rsquo;s estimated time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The courses are similar to taking a school class. The Academy team provides short videos that cover individual topics around the block editor. The team also provides a PDF version of the lesson for those who prefer text over video format. At the end of the lesson, users take a quiz and move on to the next lesson. A score of 80% or more is considered a passing grade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team keeps each lesson digestible enough to complete in a short bout. Even if watching the videos, the PDF version of the lessons, which are high quality and have loads of useful information with links to third-party resources, are recommended reading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team has provided a preview of the block editor course via YouTube:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Moving to the Block Editor and Building Training Courses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Joost de Valk, founder and CPO of Yoast, said the team would continue building on the training course over time as new features are added to the block editor. There are no plans to update it on a strict schedule, but the team wants to keep it current.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yoast, as a company, focuses on SEO. Therefore, some of the advice offered through the course puts focus on creating content that is useful for people and friendly for search engines. One of the primary topics the course touches on is publishing &ldquo;resources&rdquo; and how this is made better by the block editor. &ldquo;Resources are larger articles, evergreen content or in our SEO terminology &lsquo;cornerstone content&rsquo;: the stuff you want to rank within the search results,&rdquo; said de Valk. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just throw some words on a page and expect to rank anymore.  You&rsquo;ll have to try a bit harder.  Gutenberg makes that extremely easy.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Yoast team has been moving its massive site to the block editor over time. &ldquo;The post types I deal with regularly are all written with the block editor, but we might have some areas of the site that aren&rsquo;t there yet,&rdquo; said de Valk. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rather large site, with e-commerce, training, jobs, etc. all built into one giant WordPress multi-site install, so that was a bit of an undertaking. We always try to dog-food stuff though, so we moved everything over quite quickly.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting the 11 million users who are using Yoast&rsquo;s products to make the switch is not quite as easy. Not everyone has embraced the block editor. &ldquo;The usage of the block editor is definitely improving, but it&rsquo;s not going as fast as we&rsquo;d like to see,&rdquo; said de Valk. &ldquo;We honestly think a lot of people don&rsquo;t understand the chances the block editor brings yet, one of the reasons for releasing this course and trying to help more people to start using it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team&rsquo;s latest SEO course had over 10,000 signups within a week. While that number is a drop in the bucket in comparison to their full user count, it is promising. With a similar turnout for the block editor training course, it may convert more users from the older classic editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putting together full training courses is a large undertaking, but these are the types of resources the WordPress community needs moving forward. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot of work,&rdquo; said de Valk. &ldquo;We have four people in our Academy team, a crew that records our videos, and our design team designs all the PDFs and slides within the videos. It&rsquo;s a non-trivial investment, but we&rsquo;re happy to make that if it helps make more people enthusiastic for the block editor.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 19:47:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"WPTavern: Block Patterns Will Change Everything\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=98017\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:139:\"https://wptavern.com/block-patterns-will-change-everything?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=block-patterns-will-change-everything\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6877:\"<img />Book sales section from a custom theme.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">It was about a year ago. I was happily designing a theme for aspiring novelists. I wanted to get ahead of the competition and market a theme specifically to writers who would be attempting the National Novel Writing Month 2019 challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NaNoWriMo, for short, is a whirlwind of a month where 1,000s of people from around the world clatter away on their keyboards to pen a 50,000-word novel manuscript. One month of sheer willpower, coffee by the gallon, and sleepless nights in exchange for glory. There are no grand prizes or guaranteed publishing contracts at the end of the journey. You nab a certificate, a few coupons, and bragging rights. I completed the challenge in 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspired by my win just months before, I built a theme for those who would be taking the journey the following year. I also wanted to broaden its appeal to anyone who might be an aspiring novelist but not necessarily participating in the challenge. Or, maybe even to someone who just published their first book. Perhaps this would be an opportunity to bring a few new WordPress users into our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I outlined a homepage layout to show how users could feature their latest book with a purchase button. Then, it dawned on me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>How could someone build this book sales page without solid experience with the block editor?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had been using the Gutenberg plugin for months upon months before it landed in WordPress 5.0. I knew the ins and outs of the system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design was simple. Using the core media &amp; text block, a heading, a couple of paragraphs, and a button, I had created something that may have been too complex for the average user. I had not even gotten into the custom color, font-size, and block-style options that accented the layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This simple combination of blocks had the potential to be overly complicated for some. I had other plans for more complex layouts. Other theme authors had taken on bigger combinations of blocks. For end-users, they were likely stepping into a world that did not make sense. They would see beautiful theme demos and grow frustrated when they could not make things work. The block editor was not, and is still not, intuitive enough for the least-knowledgeable users to build layouts beyond the basics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I opted for a step-by-step tutorial to guide my users into building this <em>simple</em> book-selling section. However, documentation is not always the best answer. Even when users find and read it, the results are not always accurate. It would have been far simpler to have a button that, when clicked, inserted this section directly into the editor. The user could then customize it to fit their content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is where <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/17335\">block patterns</a> come in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors should be able to build unique and complex combinations of blocks with custom styles. Users should be able to just <em>make it look like the demo</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since &ldquo;building&rdquo; (I use this term loosely) my first WordPress theme in 2005, I have either seen or attempted every manner of solution to this problem. Page templates. Theme options. Shortcodes. Widgets. You name it. They have all been tried before. Each method provided major hurdles for users. Some (<em>ahem, shortcodes</em>) left users&rsquo; content in shambles and created a lock-in effect where they ended up tied down to their theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is long past time for something new.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Are Block Patterns and How Will They Improve User Experience?</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom pricing columns section.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">What happens when a user wants to build a layout with multiple columns of pricing options as shown in the above screenshot? Good luck. Most could not produce it with the block system. Even without block patterns, the theme would need some custom block styles to make it possible. Plugins will likely fill in the void for such complex output and have been tackling pricing tables in various ways over the years. What if we could produce layouts like this within themes or in much simpler plugins?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is possible with block patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, a block pattern is a group of blocks. Core WordPress, themes, and plugins will be able to register patterns with predefined settings attached to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the average user&rsquo;s point of view, block patterns are predefined sections they can use to create layouts. These layouts can be something as simple as the book section from earlier in this article to the more complex pricing columns. With these patterns available, users will be able to create complex layouts at the click of a button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block system laid the foundation for a much different and forward-compatible future than what we have experienced over the years. At the end of the day, most blocks are just plain old HTML. Block patterns will be nothing more than the registration of a group of these blocks. When a user switches themes, their content remains intact, even when their new theme does not register the same patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-7-7-ships-refreshed-ui-and-first-iteration-of-block-patterns\">Version 7.7 of the Gutenberg plugin</a> shipped the first iteration of an interface for patterns. It is basic and will undergo several more iterations before it is ready for use in production. Eventually, there will be a fully-integrated interface for selecting from multiple patterns. The user sees something they want to use. They click on that pattern. It gets inserted into the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No more complicated theme options. No more shortcode soup. No more hours of frustration wondering why you cannot build that custom front page shown in that carefully-crafted theme demo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I may be a tad optimistic. Block patterns will require massive buy-in from the theme and plugin developer community. While core WordPress will ship several popular patterns by default, they will in no way cover the breadth of design that is possible when theme authors put their artistic skills to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have always been excited about the block editor. However, it has always felt like I was more excited about the <em>potential</em> than the end product. I was in a constant state of waiting for it to become the thing I thought it could be. Yes, I am still waiting. However, tinkering with an early version of the pattern system feels like we are getting to the point where we can do those awesome things the editor was supposed to allow us to accomplish. It has been a long wait, and we still have a bit to go. But, I have a renewed passion for the project after experiencing the work that has been done thus far.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 20:12:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WPTavern: Still No Wood Grain: WP Tavern Design Update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=97987\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:151:\"https://wptavern.com/still-no-wood-grain-wp-tavern-design-update?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=still-no-wood-grain-wp-tavern-design-update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2924:\"<img />WP Tavern homepage design.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">It has been a bit of a slow news week in the land of WordPress with the COVID-19 pandemic reaching across the globe. Most people are hunkering down or getting accustomed to a change in their daily lives. For some people, that has meant figuring out a way to work with children at home. For others, it has meant they cannot take their daily lunch with colleagues or friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With far less WordPress-specific news going on, it made for an ideal time to put some work into the WP Tavern website. Most weeks, I am far too busy sifting through stories to put the amount of work I want into updating the design, but I am trying to treat this week as a little bit of a blessing and look at the upside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not much has changed with the overall layout of the site, but I was able to tackle a couple of issues that you, our readers, have been asking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest change that you will notice is a new header design. On mobile devices, it will look the same. However, on larger screens, the header expands to reveal a search form with a navigation menu below. The header colors have been updated. With more horizontal space, the menu also has extra links pointing to our primary categories, which has also been an oft-requested change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While these changes may seem minor, I wanted to address some of the bigger user-experience issues that you all have messaged about. There is still more work to do, but I want you to know that we are listening to your feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The major roadblock with this design iteration was related to the block editor&rsquo;s markup changes. These changes will <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/preparing-for-wordpress-5-4-changes-theme-and-plugin-developers-should-know-about\">land in WordPress 5.4</a>, so theme authors need to make sure they are prepared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to spend more time working on front-end updates, but correcting editor issues took precedence. It has not been a great experience writing on the site for the past week without theme styles being properly applied. The block editor&rsquo;s default font size is far too small for my poor eyesight, so backend work moved to the top of the to-do list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from those changes, I cleaned up several trivial issues that have been bugging me but would go unnoticed by visitors.

While that will work for the majority of a theme&rsquo;s output, the trouble is figuring out how the project will handle dynamic values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the discussion has centered on handling URLs, which are probably the most common use case. Currently, theme templates have all sorts of dynamic content. Much of that will be replaced with blocks as we continue moving toward full-site editing. However, not all dynamic data will have a block equivalent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good example is that theme authors cannot currently add the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/20542\">homepage URL to the navigation block</a>. Some experimental block-based themes are using a simple <code>/</code> character, which points to the wrong location on many WordPress installs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solving this issue sooner rather than later is important for the progression of theme development in a block world. However, such a solution needs to be carefully crafted so that the theming community is not bogged down by a decade or more with a poor templating implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Current Proposals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gutenberg repository currently has an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/20966\">open ticket for discussion</a> on handling dynamic values in templates. At the moment, there are four proposals on how to address the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>On-the-Fly String Replacement</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One solution would be to use PHP to parse each HTML file and replace strings representing dynamic data on the fly. This would require parsing all of a theme&rsquo;s templates on every page load. The downside is that it would slow down the page load. We would need real unit tests to see how much of a spike in loading time this method creates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming a <a href=\"https://mustache.github.io/\">Mustache</a>-like syntax, templates would have values such as the following image output:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;img src=\"{{ theme_image_example }}\" /&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>One added benefit of adopting such a solution is that WordPress could automatically escape these dynamic values by default. This would be a boon to theme security, which is one of the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/data-from-theme-reviews-shows-authors-need-more-education-on-developing-secure-wordpress-themes\">biggest issues faced by the theme review team</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>One-Time String Replacement</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The second solution proposes using the same method but parsing the HTML files once, upon theme activation, and replacing dynamic values with proper values. The largest benefit of this method is that the parsing would not affect front-end loading speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This method is problematic because it does not account for changes to templates after the initial parsing. It also does not handle scenarios when a value changes via user input. For example, a user may decide to change the location of their blog posts page. Therefore, a parsed URL that becomes static would point to the wrong location.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Templates as JSON</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A third solution proposes the idea of turning theme files into JSON. It is far easier to parse and extract data from a JSON file than and HTML file. However, theme designers do not write JSON to build template output. HTML exists for a reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This solution would raise the barrier so high for new theme authors that it would be rare for those who just learned basic CSS and HTML to get into WordPress theme development. This idea is so foreign to the idea of template design, that it should not be a serious consideration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Templates That Return Blocks via PHP</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The fourth and final proposal is to use PHP files with a function that returns a block template. This method would be straightforward and could be picked up easily for existing theme authors who have a familiarity with PHP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A template would look something like the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>function my_theme_front_page() {\n	return \'&lt;!-- wp:cover {\"url\":\"\' . get_template_directory_uri() .\'/block-background-image.png\",\"id\":273,\"dimRatio\":0,\"minHeight\":647,\"align\":\"wide\"} --&gt;\';\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This idea puts more focus on PHP than HTML. It would be the easiest-to-implement solution for the Gutenberg development team. However, like the JSON method, it would raise the barrier to entry for first-time theme authors. It will mean making sure quote and double-quote characters do not get mixed up. The method would be prone to bugs and looks alien to modern-day templating.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Templating Should Focus on HTML</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Templating should always be HTML-first. Even in our current theme system, theme authors can build beautiful, safe, and functional themes by simply knowing HTML and CSS. PHP is secondary, especially when it comes to the templating aspect. Our templating system relies on knowing HTML and plugging in a few <em>template tags</em>, which are PHP functions that WordPress provides for dropping in between HTML tags. This simplicity is, in part, what made WordPress theme development so easy to learn for anyone willing to put in a little time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block-based themes have the potential to drop the barrier even lower than our current templating system. However, templates as JSON or PHP functions runs counter to that. Any solution that pushes us farther away from the basic building blocks of the web, HTML, should not be on the table for discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may be time to adopt a proper PHP templating engine. There are plenty of examples out there. <a href=\"https://twig.symfony.com/\">Twig</a>, <a href=\"https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/blade\">Blade</a>, <a href=\"https://www.smarty.net/\">Smarty</a>, and others have existed for years. Those also have some barrier to entry in the form of new syntax, but this should be no tougher than learning to plug template tags into the current system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the very least, we will need to figure out a solution for handling dynamic data in what is essentially static HTML files.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 20:37:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"Matt: Physical Distancing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=51063\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"https://ma.tt/2020/03/physical-distancing/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1303:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I&#8217;ve really had enough of this term &#8220;social distancing.&#8221; That is not at all what we are looking for, is it?

Here Today she is an experienced psychologist has worked with all types of people across the spectrum in particular how we got to know each other is her work with entrepreneurs. She is an entrepreneur, she happens to be married to a serial entrepreneur, but I love the breadth and depth of her experience, particularly with trauma. And so, amidst the circumstances, we find ourselves today, I texted Sherry and said, Would you do a q&#038;a? Would you just have a conversation with me? And she said, &#8220;Absolutely.&#8221; Sherry, thank you for the time today. This is vital that we keep this conversation on and I appreciate you be willing to share your experience and expertise with whoever\'s on the webinar today.\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> Yeah, thanks so much for asking. Cory and I had — we\'ve had — lots of conversations related to mental health and the need for an open conversation about mental health in entrepreneur communities that we kind of live and work and breathe in. So I\'m always grateful for the way that you are hosting conversations where people get to be honest about what they\'re needing and what part and also share what\'s helpful.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> Absolutely. Well, just if you join And you can help me help others as they join the webinar late perhaps, and I\'m talking to our attendees, that little button that says q&#038;a on the bottom zoom, hit that and ask a question along the way, but Jerry and I are just going to geek out and have a conversation. And so I\'m glad you can join us for it. Okay, Doctor,\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> —this is also what it\'s like to have a coffee with Cory and me, by the way.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> Exactly. Okay, doctor. The world is a little bit chaotic right now.\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> Yeah, I noticed.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> Um, I feel like this. This conversation is pertinent because right now, if we just kind of stay, here\'s where I\'m going at what I\'m going through. I\'ve got two kids and now you\'ve got three. Were quarantined. No school for the foreseeable future. They\'re talking about in Kansas, for instance, I think shutting down school for the end of the year. End of the school year. There\'s, I don\'t even want to look at my stock market equities stuff. Um, what are you feeling?\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> You know, I think I go up and down probably like everybody else. So the pain point just for me personally right now is that I am continuing to work my husband is continuing to work because thankfully both of us still have work to do. And both of us have jobs that are fairly possible to do from home. But now we have all three of our children home off the road children who go to three different schools who are now trying to throw together online education over a weekend and you know, all of us who do work on the internet can appreciate that that\'s not very easy to do. So all my kids are like, how do I like it? How do I do this, how to do that, like nobody, none of the systems are flowing and that is, of course unnecessary. In where the best case scenario you\'ve got two parents who are used to working from home and are flexible and things like that. So the bottom line is that there is no normal anymore for a while for anyone. And so there\'s a great deal of as you know, just anxiety and the need to be able to be extraordinarily flexible in a way that none of us are used to doing because especially those of us that run businesses we plan we look at spreadsheets, we think we\'re strategic, and all of those bands are not relevant right now for the foreseeable future, which is extraordinary—\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> So the one emotion I guess, that comes to mind in all of this and I\'m speaking from personal experience here is fear. I think it was the first word I mentioned to you — so much fear — some of it just fear on fear, you know, just accounting fear. You can\'t go online or watch TV without being just bombarded about it. So if you had a microphone right now and the entire world could hear it and all their native languages and stuff, when we talk about fear, and fear produces anxiety, all this stuff. We can\'t we can get frozen in it. What? What\'s something you would say?\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> I mean, in a way, I think we\'re all feeling it in our bodies. Like when even you say the word fear, like your la just kind of gets tight. Your chest gets heavy, it\'s hard to breathe. And on one hand, it feels really disingenuous to say don\'t be afraid. But on the other hand, we are all in the same boat and we will all All survived one way or another together. So I think the extent to which we can slow down that fear response and breathe and look around to see what is directly controllable which, you know for many of us is our bodies you know have gone on a walk today joining me to lay down for a nap What does my body need at this moment? Do I need just a really big glass of water, like the really, really simple things that are directly controllable help to counterbalance this sense of fear which comes from being out of control? And so getting really specific, slowing down, keeping life as simple as possible. They sound so simple, but of course, when we actually try to put them into practice, they\'re profound and somewhat difficult. But the, you know, the fear is in and of itself, its own problem. So turning down that fear even if it\'s well-grounded fear I\'m I mean, I\'m under No, no delusion that everything is fine. Everything is not fine, but the fear doesn\'t help.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> Yeah, there\'s so much in there I want to impact. So when I think it was like a couple of days ago kids were home because of spring break here in Oklahoma. And we\'re looking at Oh, man, will they go back to school? markets, all that stuff. And I remember walking out that night and just looking at the beautiful sunset and going, the sun is still setting in the next morning when I woke up is still rose again. It\'s this weird thing. I guess we haven\'t told the son that there\'s a chaotic thing happening right now. But some of those things. One I think you just give us freedom and permission to know that fear is a human experience. But I like the words you said there — &#8220;what are the things we can control?&#8221; And I\'m probably an admitted control freak. What are some of the prompts you ask yourself or your clients or others about that I want to get to? &#8220;Walk&#8221; and &#8220;sunshine&#8221; and all that because I know there\'s a big word called &#8220;play&#8221; that you love, you\'ve helped introduce back to me. But, you know, for me, it\'s fun. It feels like okay, what can I control? You know, our responses potentially to freeze in the fear, let it compound and just suffocate us. And I go, what are the things I can\'t control? What are the things I know are fact like, you know, the sun setting and rising the next day?\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> Yeah, I mean, I do think we can, we can control our body, sleep, food movement, we control our breasts, the ability to take slow deep breaths, we can control our thoughts. To some extent, and we can go back to breath in a minute, you want to talk more about that. But like, we can control our thoughts to some extent. And that\'s, that is the thing that I think feels really difficult right now. Because I know like you like my instinct is like, every time I pick up this magical device to be like, how many more? How many more cases are there? What\'s the market doing? Like, you know which borders are closed, which is open. You know, there\'s so much and I think some of the control that we all want to exert right now is to really limit the amount of factoids and information that we\'re, we\'re accessing right now. Like, obviously, it is an important time to have good healthy information on which to make decisions, but the amount of information is, is really not helpful. So 15 minutes in the morning, 15 minutes a night should probably do, yeah, you don\'t need to have your newsfeed buzzing all day. So controlling titrating turning up and down the volume around which you\'re exposed to information is helpful, that helps control your thoughts. Even specifically skewing your thoughts one way or another. I mean, his is the best time in the world for our gratitude practice, again, not because we need to walk around pretending it\'s all sunshine and roses, but because right now we\'re on this call and we\'re all breathing. And we\'re all okay so far. And that, in and of itself is I think going to become profoundly important to remember the things that are going well the things that are intact, the things that we can be grateful for. That helps to put some parameters around the power of fear to begin to sort of control our minds.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> Yeah, I love that. The things you just mentioned are all just so simple. I think we have a tendency to &#8230; skim over them, but the fact that we can just take a breath and gratitude. I hadn\'t had that on the list before we talked, but gratitude those are things we absolutely control. In the past groups you and I have done together, you\'ve really led. You really talk about the breath. And I know, yoga is a deep part of your life. I know. And that is not all about the breath. But you know, I know this is something we all have at our disposal right now, as you just said. Can you share some practices, some thoughts about that?\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> So the super-fast version of the science is that there\'s this thing called the vagus nerve, which is based in our brainstem and then goes all the way throughout our bodies and after these tendrils of connection and all of our major organs, and that\'s a part of their bodies that declares all as well. So after we have that anxiety response, it\'s the vagus nerve that signals Okay, we\'re good now, like the tiger is not going to eat us today. And that is the part of the body that in a way we kind of want to hack those of you who coders here, do you want to hack to be able to say, Okay, I need to take my body into palm because my body\'s been living in fear. Anxiety too long. So the breath is this strategy that we use to help signal the all-clear sign to end the emergency response. You think about, it\'s almost impossible to be really upset and breathe really slowly there. There\'s kind of antithetical physical realities. So when we can engage our vagus nerve through deep, slow breath, we\'re essentially sort of pushing the dominoes to fall toward calm both in our mind and in our physiological reality. So the simplest practice, like the Easy, easy way to do this, is I call it it\'s just four by four breaths. So it\'s four seconds in, four seconds out, for birth should begin to turn the tide. It doesn\'t have to be this deep, 30-minute sort of meditation where you go into some existential Zen Nirvana place. Just really, that was a terrible cultural statement, I\'m sorry, but four deep breaths. And the breath should be low and slow, which means we\'re pulling the breath all the way down into our belly or diaphragm and slowing it down. So lots of like apps and YouTube things about this. We can end with a breath practice if we have time. But it\'s beyond yoga and meditation. It\'s just really, really great concrete science to help counteract that anxiety response.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> Well, this is something you know, I\'ve read navy seals and combat. They control their breath. They weren\'t maybe before but you know, they weren\'t. So think about that in crisis. That first instinct is to take a big deep breath, but I love the former for practice, Southern by—\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> I didn\'t learn that in yoga, I learned it working in with the military. Oh, that\'s right. That\'s right.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> Well, I\'d invite everybody right now and your own while we\'re talking. Let\'s do that the four by four, four slow, deep breaths in, slip four out. We\'re going to continue your conversations because I\'ve got a lot to talk this year about, by the way, and I\'m glad you\'re eavesdropping on our conversation. gratitude. It\'s that one that it\'s like, I know the science the studies are there. And it\'s that one that man, I just — my mind just wants to focus on all the junk, all the chaos. But it\'s kind of like that you\'re the former for deep breath is telling you. I love your statement there. It\'s hard to do both of these negative and positive things at the same time. So it is to pick feels that way was gratitude too, though. Yeah.\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> I think when you\'re when you\'re acknowledging, making a list three to five things that you\'re grateful for. And that can be the fact that hey, I don\'t have to go to the doctor today. Or, you know, my kids are able to relate lead. So worst-case scenario can give him a book and we can call that school I mean there it can be really, really simple things it\'s pretty impossible to feel like everything is horrible when you can find those five things to be grateful for. So even you know, those of you who live with other people this is a great practice for the dinner table. When I was growing up, we would begin our meal with a prayer my family doesn\'t practice that tradition anymore, but we do begin our meal with a gratitude, and so each of our children will go around and just say one or two things that that are they\'re thankful are happening right now.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> And what a great pair with the breathing you know, finding yourself going down the anxiety true deep, getting lost into feeling suffocated, whatever those sensations are, but then going back to the breath and gratitude. I think you\'re just really fantastic. You know, worry. So one thing that comes to mind for me is when something happens, I go catastrophe mode. And another fancy phrase, phrase for this is cognitive distortion, I believe cognitive bias traffic—\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> —traffic thinking, yeah.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> And I would bet you money that a lot of people go cash-free to, like the markets crashing, my 401k is screwed. Like, I\'m not going to be rich, I\'m going to be working until I\'m 110 I live that low kind of thing. And that feels like something when we talk about worry is that our mind can it can work against us, too. What are some thoughts about that? My mind goes racing, I got a contest free I got a Yeah, you know, there is no I mean, the world is, you know, ending in my mind. I can see it all — all the bad things that could potentially happen. And how do I, how do I reset? I mean, we\'ve just talked about breath for sure and gratitude, but how do we combat some of the — I call it my inner jerk.\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> So I have maybe a little bit of a different take on that, especially right now, which is to like, let your inner jerk have his moment. So, you know, it\'s to sort of maybe sit down with Lindsey or meet with my husband, Rob, sort of say like, what is the worst-case scenario? Like? If we haven\'t, you know, to basically put it on your calendar, we\'re going to have two hours of catastrophe planning. And we\'re going to talk about all of the things that are going to fall for us it meant we like updated our will, you know, like, hey, both of us died from this virus who\'s going to watch our kids who haven\'t done in a while. We bought a hand-crank radio. So I don\'t know how the power is going to go out from coronavirus but like, you know, we have one in the basement now. So it\'s basically acknowledgment that you call it the jerk but like the sort of paranoid voice. So it lives in your head, is there as an attempt to protect you? Like, he\'s not really a jerk? He\'s just like, hey, Cory, are you paying attention? And so when we give them a moment and sort of say, Okay, what do you need to tell me? You know, and what can I possibly do with what is within my control my power to prepare for the end of the world? There might be some things, right you know, we have a really stupid radio thing, we have more batteries that we need, canned food &#8230; So I would say make an appointment with your, the crisis manager that lives in your head and give he or she a couple of hours of your focused attention and follow whatever recommendations are reasonable and you can reasonably do and then when that voice resurfaces, you can say &#8220;it\'s cool, dude, I got the hand-crank radio in the basement, like we did that, yeah, we have a water filter, you know? Or, you know, we\'ve got some gold or you know&#8230;&#8221; Certainly, lots of these scenarios we can\'t perfectly plan for. But I think when we give that alarmist voice a little bit of airtime and make a plan accordingly, it helps to sue that more than just sort of push it down and say, Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. You\'re a jerk because I don\'t know I don\'t think he\'s a jerk or I think he\'s just trying to help you out.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> Yes, a jerk voice though sometimes, but yeah, we\'ll get no I love that because I think there\'s this sense insane, like, make an appointment, bro. And then just my counselor a couple weeks ago, I was stressing about something like catastrophe. It wasn\'t related to this. Because Okay, tell me what you\'re gonna do. Keep going down the cash-free room. Okay. And I went dark and I went deep, and I started the video. Kind of laughing because I could hear myself say things and go do I really think this catastrophe is gonna happen? But I love your advice is that I mean there is some there\'s probably some sense of safety. I\'m just thinking like, I want to go by hand-cranked radio, you know, but like I think there\'s some sense of like you\'ve acknowledged it like you said, but also go in your head. There\'s a hand-crank radio, by the way. Hey, remember, I did listen to you. He may not be perfect for FEMA executive director, but you\'re helping me and I think what you\'re saying to Sherry is acknowledging that that also is natural that that inner the prey maybe not so jerk. She\'s there for good reason too.\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> The alarm is protection has a role. We don\'t let it go crazy, but it doesn\'t also help to sort of shove it in the closet.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> Yeah, then just pulls up even probably worse, when when you don\'t, you know, let these human things part of being human, kind of acknowledge them and, you know, thousands of years ago were in us biologically to help us survive and I think that\'s good. Okay, so we\'ve talked about fear worry, there\'s some in that I think some of the uncertainty and some really good ways to tackle that. So let\'s switch gears just a tad in the situation we find ourselves in we just acknowledge like, you\'ve got three kiddos. I\'ve got two kiddos were sequestered at home, you know? Yeah. So it\'s, it\'s crazy. You know, Sherry have talked so long about that, trying to provide resources into the world that says I\'m not alone. Yet this phenomenon that\'s trending which is a good reason for this particular this pandemic is social distancing. But we\'re sequestered in our house. You know? So this the situation we\'re in, I want to talk about parenting to and spouse, significant other roommates, all that. But, yeah, isolation. I mean, we have to oscillate in order to flatten that curve and do the right things and everything but there\'s a real phenomenon that we\'re pushing deeper into, which is isolation, social distancing, which is good for maybe a virus but not for our emotional high.\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> Yeah.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> What are your thoughts about we\'re in our bunkers, right? We\'re in right we\'re told don\'t high five and hug. Yeah. Don\'t go Yeah, middle of groups, whether it be churches or groups for instance, or, you know, our workplaces. were told to go isolate like&#8230;\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> — and that is where, you know, again, this magical device in my hand becomes really powerful because I can still FaceTime my mom in California. And, you know, I\'m having, you know, a zoom snack later with my friend Anna. Like, I think that register zooms back. We\'re not drinking right now. So we\'re having Zoom snacks instead of Zoom drinks. But I think that, you know, the danger is that we mistake Facebook feed or twitter feed for connection. And there\'s a utility there, but it\'s not the kind of connection that we\'re craving. But if we get on the phone, get face to face, over the devices, with friends with people, we love that that\'s still a way to have a really meaningful connection that we all desperately need. Even the kids need, you know, my kids are facetiming a lot more people than normal. So, so Social distancing is about, you know, spreading germs. It\'s not about our hearts and our minds. social connection is as important if not more important than it\'s ever been before. And that\'s where technology is suddenly really, really helpful for all of us. But the thing that I want to stress is that it\'s intentional. It\'s connected, it\'s heart to heart. It\'s not just like reading the highlight reel on Facebook. Like that\'s not the kind of connection that we all necessarily need. It\'s the appointment. Let\'s sit down and talk. Tell me how you\'re feeling. What\'s driving you crazy. What are you grateful for? What\'s bringing you joy right now?\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> Those are great questions, like, just phone a friend or having a zoom snack. What\'s bringing you joy right now? What do you mean? You just, I see your Taekwondo here. You\'re a ninja. You\'re like, okay, ask the question. Maybe it\'s a conversation with someone who is a dear friend. Some of you haven\'t talked to a loved one. Back to the gratitude. Hey, can we have a deep breath together? I love that. Someone and by the way, let me just take a moment to say if you have a question, hit the Q&#038;A button at the bottom of the Zoom window. And you can ask an anonymous question. A couple have come in. I\'ll take those in just a minute. But one of them said, Sherry, I really liked this distinction. Any thoughts on tape, changing the term social distancing to physical distancing? You can still be social. But yeah, it\'s there. There\'s a physical distance — \n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> —allotted for it. Yeah. \n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> Yeah. I like that distinction. So maybe, I mean, I tend to think share a —  try to think — take problems and see the opportunity in it. And you know, there\'s probably some kind of sunshine quote, I should figure that out. You know, like, every Rain, Rain is the rainbow or something. But there are opportunities were sequestered. It might be an opportunity where we\'re not in a busy office or having to run around like, you know, take kids to school and practice that we\'ve got a little bit more time to And can use that to reach out to somebody we haven\'t. And, and I really, really, really like that and using technology, not trying to replace it. But right now it\'s a, it\'s an opportunity we have FaceTime is free soon, I\'ll have your zoom snack thing. So&#8230;\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> Yeah, it\'s a good time to make a list of a couple of people who you haven\'t talked to in a while or who might be having a rough time of it. You know, I, I know my mom is quarantined all by herself in her big house in California. And she\'s, you know, when can come and no one can go and that\'s, so we\'re talking every day and we don\'t normally talk every day. And like, my yoga teachers and my kids, music instructors, like people who are really woven into the fabric of our lives, who have no income, all of a sudden, I\'m sending them notes. So I think you know, we can again, we can change our frame of mind to say who needs a virtual high five, who needs a little reach out, who\'s going to be lonely? And I think that also helps our own mental health when we realize there\'s a lot I can do to be helpful. It doesn\'t involve maybe even finances or even just involve some fullness. So that\'s good for everybody.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> So we\'ve talked about just now about the forward, you know, pushing forward and reaching out. I want to switch in real quick and say, how do we ask for help? And you know, man sure this is hard. This is tough. I like to keep things bottled up. I like to try to be Superman, and do everything myself. But there is a very real-time this one, this is every single day, not just in the pain demo. Right now. It\'s heightened for even more of the population, I think, reaching out and saying I do need help. I do need support and how to do that.\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> Yeah, I, I think this is really a tough one, especially for, again, our entrepreneur, brothers and sisters, because we\'re really used to being pretty autonomous and pretty capable of handling things ourselves. And all kinds of help is going to be needed, right? financial help, just emotional sanity help. Addiction help, parenting help. Like, I feel like there\'s really a pretty nightmare scenario where we\'re, we\'re stuck in the house, it\'s easy to start drinking more, it\'s easy to be a little more abrasive or rougher with your kids because they\'re going crazy and you\'re going crazy. You know, I just think there are lots of dominoes that could fall in a bad way and to be able to call someone and just say like, Okay, can you just talk to me for 10 minutes like I need a break from what\'s happening right now. Maybe you don\'t even have to use the H-word. Maybe you can say like, hey, &#8220;Just tell me a story from your day?&#8221; or &#8220;What are you reading right now,&#8221; you know, just get connected in a way that gets you out of the cycle that you\'re in. And there also may be times where you just really do need help to say, I can\'t pay my rent right now, or I have no work. Do you have, you know, reach out to some people? Do you have any extra projects or things that I can help you with? Or that it? I think the thing is that everyone is going to need help, you know, there\'s not going to be a family that\'s sort of untouched by all of this. And so we as leaders, as entrepreneurs, as people who are aware can now begin to set a new trend where now is just part of the vernacular to ask for an offer to help.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> Yep. And I think we said examples about that, too, is I mean, I think many of us — I won\'t say most — many of us, and I\'ll just say myself, I\'m good at offering help. I\'m terrible at asking for help, you know, and I let it go too far and it gets, it gets tough. And I think you\'ve hit a resonating thing, which is, this is not the time for social isolations in the sense of not the physical, we get to watch that with the virus, but that this is the time to lean in on connection and doing those to this amazing technology. We have the internet to do so free resources to do so. So I appreciate that. Okay, Sherry, I want to talk about things that I know you have put like squarely on my plate for so long. And if you follow Sherry on Instagram, you know, she does aerial yoga, I believe is the name of it.\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> That\'s all my Instagram is.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> It\'s all she told me a couple like a week ago she was she said she was two weeks ago. She was in Vegas and she was going to the circus on site. I remember the circus and that wasn\'t actually the circus. It was aerial yoga. The Circus I remember. But the word that I\'m coming to share is the one that you\'ve really helped introduced to me, which is called play, like most of us think play was when I was a kid. It\'s what my kids do. But you\'ve been very intentional about talking about play. And its necessity and I think it might tie into, I\'m gonna approach it again, exercise the things that we could do. You know, we talked about the breath, we talked about gratitude, there\'s play this component that I would love for you to tell me more about us about and then exercise too, and how to dance really.\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> It\'s really counterintuitive, because I think we need play more than ever, but the world feels so very serious. And especially those of us who are grownups with lots of grand responsibilities. We can feel a lot of pressure to live in that seriousness all the time and our bodies and our minds really need play, which is essentially a word that It describes being part of an activity purely for the joy of it for a sense of getting lost in it for a sense of you know, flow is another word. Because it sort of stimulates your curiosity and your sense of joy not because it leads to a certain kind of outcome. So people play in lots of ways I happen to have fallen in love with play related to circus, which is very physical, but, you know, playing music, playing by cooking by, you know, working through a cookbook, so I think, you know, if anything, I would love to challenge each of us to find a quarantine play activity. Maybe that\'s building a new york Lego set, or maybe it\'s, you know, mastering handstands or something that is a break from the heaviness of life and just lets you be joyful and light-hearted Again, it\'s a counterbalance, we have all of this heaviness. So we need to introduce some more lightness, we have all of this sadness and fear, we need to introduce more joy. We have all of this like deep, difficult intellectual problem solving to do we need to introduce more sort of nonlinear, playful, less structured ways of thinking and ways of using our brains. So play the engages the body is like doubly helpful because you have all the benefits of play and then all of the benefits of movement. But play doesn\'t. It doesn\'t have to be physical. It\'s just, you know, it\'s nice if it is you just want to be able to lose yourself in something.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> Yeah, by the way, if you\'re not following Sherry on Twitter, you need to. I\'ve stolen her ideas that she tweets&#8230;. Please keep doing this. One of them was talking about Legos and I was like, you know, Calloway my son that\'s got a roomful of Legos, man. Maybe we could reconstruct the things. He\'s completely obliterated. Going back to that joyful time like, it could be, you know, doodling what thinking back as a kid and going What? What brought you joy that you\'d like lost yourself in video games, whatever. I know you even mentioned to Netflix and chill like, you brought up one on Twitter By the way, she\'s at Zen founder. And I\'ll give you her website address, which is Sherry walling calm too, as well. But you mentioned the West Wing on the classics that we bought. And so, we\'ve been just a couple things. But I love this it could be what is that art, like breaking out the instrument, you know, the musical instrument, you know, that\'s dusty in the closet or, you know, something and I love that you continually and you follow you know, Sherry scream, you will see that she loves the play aspect, and I think that\'s such a great reminder for me every time I see it, I\'m like, I don\'t know if I could do the aerobatic stuff, but—\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong>—you could if you made it your ambition.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> That\'s true. I can make it—\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong>—into your quarantine project, you could.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> Yeah. And I love you how you\'ve paired also, it doesn\'t have to but me, you know, exercise being kind of the wonder drug, getting your heart rate up doing something which we can all maybe do a push up or sit up for something, even in our confined space to do that, and, you know, I can remember the book offhand but you know, he says that wonder drug so finding something within your, you know, physical space to do YouTubing some things I think is great just getting that body, you know, what do you call that? pulse, the heart —\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> &#8230;heart rate elevator getting some adrenaline, some endorphins flowing. I mean, it\'s also good old fashioned catharsis, right, for he talked about this the sense of like, just moving big emotion, through and out of the body. And we know that the longer that emotions are sitting stagnant in us, especially stress, it causes a lot of chemical changes within our body. So if we can engage in whether it\'s playful or just deeply physical activities that help, like, shift around to that chemistry, it\'s much better for us in the long run. So things like dancing are both like neurologically stimulating because you\'re like, what? Which left foot which one is left and where does it go? But also take you they require you to think about something that\'s not the coronavirus or your you know, your business spreadsheets. So something that engages your mind, as well as your body, is really, really helpful.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> Yeah, like that. So, you know, Sherry Lindsey is listening and I don\'t like to dance. First thing, you know, she\'s gonna say is like, let\'s do it. Let\'s dance.\n\n[laughing] Cory.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> Well, I want to, I want to make sure we have some time and space for questions and there\'s a couple that have come in Sherry and again, by the way, hit that Q&#038;A button right there, and you can do it anonymously. I will be the only one that sees the actual questions and but it also says anonymous when you click anonymous. So please hit that. There are a couple of questions. So you just hit on stress, or you know, use the word stress in your sentence. And so one of the questions was, my spouse is in a complete state of denial, running a manufacturing plant, and when the shade the state has shut down all the essential stuff. So what if, what if you have people in your life that are in a sense of like, denial? And I\'ve honestly, I\'ll tell you, some people that don\'t really take the measures that the CDC and government officials that know way more about these things than me have suggested don\'t take it. Don\'t take it very seriously. So, thoughts on thoughts on how to handle the denial or you know, lack of seriousness about the issues at hand?\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> Yeah, that\'s a tough one in a family for sure. I mean, I think it\'s helpful that those conversations happen very intentionally. So as opposed to, like, you know, in this scenario, it\'s partners that live together. Like, you\'re not doing dishes or sort of running from one thing to another or like, you\'re not distracted, but you sit down and you say to your significant other, like, I, I appreciate that you see this way. I see it in a different way. And I am quite concerned and I would like your help in implementing some of these measures for our family. And you just make it a very personal conversation. You don\'t try to go, you know, toe to toe or head to head about like which news sources which and you know, how many people die of the flu versus how many I mean, don\'t just don\'t engage in the kind of infowar and just say &#8220;hi&#8221; to me It\'s gonna help my heart. Yep. If you just stay home for two weeks, like just as a favor to me, like let\'s just bunker up together. And I think not try to, you know, sort of went over someone\'s mind as much as you just asked for their heart can be a little bit more compelling than trying to debate them into submission, which you know, never works.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> Well and I didn\'t get to this but it brings up the topic and there are two questions on this kind of thing, which is now we\'re isolated with our family that we don\'t spend 24 hours a day with basically, yeah, and now we look on potentially weeks of doing this. There\'s going to be inevitable conflict arguments. It\'s, you know, it can feel like in the isolation &#8230; with people. And I know I\'m not the best to always get along but Okay, so here\'s, here\'s a couple of thoughts here that came in through anonymous questions if your employer wants you to work 100% but you can\'t because of kids, not having a workspace, etc. How do you maintain that boundary without pushing yourself too hard?\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> Yeah, I mean, I think everybody is, is sort of having a lot more attuned to what they need. So, you know, talking with your significant other unit. So for example, today I have a monster day I\'ve just scheduled from nine to six straight just the day that it is for me today. Friday, much more flexible. So I sat down with Rob and I said, Look, you\'re on duty on Wednesday, because I\'m really busy. But I\'m Friday, I\'ll be on duty, we got to sort of trade back and forth. So talking with the people in your house about what they need what you need. I\'ve also sat down with each of my kids individually and said, Hey, guys, here\'s the reality like all of us are home. The house cleaner is not common. Nobody can leave. Your mom and your dad were both more stressed than normal. So and I know You\'re more stressed than normal. So here are some of the things that I need from you. What do you need from me? So I mean, my youngest is nine. But so we\'re having some really open dialogue about stress and emotion and how that affects our household and how our household runs. I think it\'s also an open conversation with your employer. I mean, many, many people are now home with their children, and again, minor nine to nine-year-olds and a 13-year-old but they can like make their own breakfast and like do things. But if I was home with a three-year-old, like, I couldn\'t be doing, you know, you can\'t work in a focused way. So that\'s a conversation with the employer to say, I need a scale my hours back or maybe I can just add six hours on Saturday so that I\'m working shorter days or I\'m mixing up my hours so I can do it when my kids are sleeping, like sit down and think about what you need to help your life kind of work and begin To ask people for that, there might be some negotiation, but there has to be flexibility from other people too. So don\'t sit here assuming I have to work full time, I have to watch my kids full time I have to, you know, like that\'s, that\'s not realistic, this is not going to be just this week, this is going to be for a while. So you have to proactively protect your energy and ask for what you need from other people, including your clients, including your employer.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> We were having this conversation and some similar, you know, stock market, all that kind of stuff work. And my thought was, you know, there\'s, let\'s say there\'s a natural disaster that happens that come through, and then there are people affected, but not everyone is affected. This particular thing, everyone, the globe, essentially, is the stock market. Everybody\'s in our place, work. Most everyone is in our place. Whether it\'s worrying about a job worrying about if you know selling We\'re going to continue. And but I think going back to what you said, just reiterating the boundaries. I mean, what a great thought there and scheduling out, this is what I\'m dealing with. It\'s what we\'re dealing with. We did that this morning talking to that now, it\'s not perfect, like you said, and that\'s the other thing is, it\'s never going to be perfect, but we\'re going to make the best of it. Okay, so we\'ve talked about parenting a little bit, and I said, You\'re not parenting, but really having people in the house. And there\'s a flip to our conversation, which is the single people that might be at home having to, you know, quarantine, and you\'ve talked about the connection there. But again, so for our single friends on the call, too, we got kind of that specific advice about searching in place alone. But what other issues or concerns and having no one to touch or runaway thoughts, for example, someone asked, you know, compelling the isolation when we\'ve talked about it parents like we\'re not I\'m going to be alone. There are people here physically with us. But you can still feel alone for sure. But for our single friends out there,\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> Yeah, I think this is a time to, to, again, get a couple of people on your list that you\'re just going to say, hey, you\'re my person for the quarantine. Let\'s check-in every day. Let\'s just make sure we\'re both Well, yeah, and I, you mentioned it may be a little in passing, but the idea of touches are a really big deal for for this sort of quarantine process. And it\'s imperfect, but like things like a really warm, fuzzy blanket things where you can sort of feel pressure on your skin, if you have a pet, that\'s great, but realizing that your body is is also going to sort of need some sense of comfort in sort of on the cellular level. So if you\'re living alone, you know, extra, like nurture on your body so you know, warm baths. lotion, things that sort of help take care of your skin or even your sort of touching your own skin. Skin sort of stimulates this sense of calm within our bodies that is pretty physiologically hardwired, warm blankets, you know, things that are heavy. And then having your list of people who are you\'re checking people, so every day, you\'re talking with someone or you\'re seeing someone\'s face, even if it\'s virtually to just be really proactive.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong>  Single buddy, I like that single buddies being there for each other leaning on each other. \n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> Or even, you know, you don\'t have to be single like my, you know, my friend Anna, who we\'re having the Zoom snack, she lives by herself. I don\'t live by myself, but I certainly would like to talk to somebody that\'s not my husband or children today. She needs a break from quiet, I need a break from them. It\'ll work.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> But I love in the absence of being able to physically touch another human being a fiver a hug. The warm blanket the heavy heavy blankets. I know if they have pets, of course, I love that specific tip. That\'s this seemed like it just resonates so deeply. Thank you for saving for your skin. Yeah, suit the suit to your skin. Yeah, absolutely. And there\'s that my daughter loves these little soft blankets and every time I touch she\'s just — and I\'m like, man, I should steal that for an hour. Hey, everybody, we have like 14 minutes. Thanks for eavesdropping on our conversation together. Sherry\'s always just I love talking to her Do you can just tell in her voice and she\'s got such a true calling and all of this and spent most of her life either in education or with clients helping people. So thank you again. Sure. It\'s been so good. Okay, so let me look through some questions real quick. Yes, this will be recorded by the way. We\'ll post it. Post it right after this or shortly after. I think We got some of that&#8230;I\'m just looking to the questions real quick. &#8220;To compound the stress, we\'re older parents one child is a senior in high school, given a stress that he wants to go out. We\'re financially strapped, scared that we will not financially make it through this. I\'m a type A personality. So this has really affected me. And again, I want to give the disclaimer for my dear friend Sherry, she\'s not doing therapy. One-on-one therapy is private. It\'s with a professional license. Sherry has just made herself available to answer questions and offer tips. But thank you, Sherry, any thoughts on you know, a situation like this where Okay, I can imagine my kids are too young, they want to go out but there\'s rain stuff. It\'s not like they can drive away. And then there\'s mention of the financial stress which is the thing that most of us, all of us are looming You know, economic crisis, for instance.\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> It kind of comes back to control what you can control. With financial stuff, you know, there are ways that we can all probably tighten up well, we\'ll have to because nobody\'s going out to eat. So, sort of planning for the worst as much as possible. But also, again, realizing everyone\'s in the same boat, like, I don\'t know what the government\'s gonna do. I don\'t know how they\'re gonna. I don\'t know how we\'re all going to put it back together. But we all will have to work together to put it back together. Because all of us are feeling it and will continue to feel it. And I know that that\'s deeply comforting, but I think it is important to realize you don\'t have to solve this on your own. And that sense of, you know, how do I work it out. Other people will feel as well. Man with the kiddo though who is like, just doing their own thing or teenager? I have a 13-year-old. He\'s like the best and worst human that I know. And Peston worse. Um, and I think you know, again, you can try to do the logic and then you just got to do the love and just say like, Hey, man, my heart won\'t let you go out. I\'m gonna hide your keys if I have to. Or, you know, if you go out like you\'re putting your whole family at risk, and maybe you don\'t care about that right now, but like I do know, it\'s a tough conversation.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. \n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> There\'s enough social pressure on everyone to help reinforce it\'s not just like, mom\'s word or dad\'s word. It\'s universal.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> So I want to ask this one to a question for entrepreneurs specifically because you are one you live with one. Rob is a tremendous human being is like you are and also brilliant entrepreneur, but you know, for someone that\'s responsible for, you know, other people\'s livelihood, potentially, yeah, as an entrepreneur, I mean, uncertainty. It\'s, we call it the roller coaster for a good reason. And this one just starting to go, you know, it\'s, it\'s going downhill and thinking, Okay, well, I know some people that potentially have restaurants or service companies or everybody feeling some sense of like, what happens if nobody can move and do anything. And then they\'re, you know, this ripple effect. Thoughts for entrepreneurs on this? This is a down this is a downward swing potentially for the roller coaster of entrepreneurship, thoughts about how we, as entrepreneurs, you know, we\'re also leading other people and how we do that. Well.\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> You know, I think, as always, there\'s an invitation for very calm, intentional communication, which is to say, Hey, this is a situation right now. I, you know, I know I\'ve got runway for\nhowever long. And then there may be a time when we need to adjust what we\'re doing. I think, again, everybody gets it. You as an entrepreneur, as a business owner with employees, you don\'t have a magic wand, you\'re doing the math like everybody else. And the more that you can just constantly communicate and do your best to keep people calm, but also give them a realistic picture so they can sort of make their choices as best they can too. You know, it\'s not easy, but don\'t put yourself in the superhero position like you can\'t save your self, your family, the whole world, all your employees like you are not responsible if you need to, like lay people off or make some different choices like there is a massive virus and that\'s what is causing this I think people sometimes take a little bit too much ownership, which is not to say be, I don\'t know, all of this is a balancing act, right? Be careful, be wise, be strategic, communicate, treat others the way that you will want to be treated. And at the end of the day, I realize that there are just really significant limits to what is within your power to do.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> That is such a dear message for my brothers and sisters that are entrepreneurs. You can\'t control everything, obviously. And you\'re not Superman they can magically or I don\'t know, some magical wizard that\'s gonna make everything better. And I like what you just said there\'s a limit there\'s to what we can do, and we\'ll try our best and communicate. So here\'s another thing too, on this kind of topic, cheery, trying to balance this Brian for his team calm and confidence but also not ignoring reality that as a lot of full unknown. And I and I would feel disingenuous, not admitting that any tips on how to walk those lines. You know, you know, you\'ve, you\'ve seen, we\'ve talked about this as being vulnerable and open with people, but not scaring the crap out of them to making the situation and that\'s a balanced two.\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> And I in a way, you know, when all else fails, you tell the truth, which is to say, Hey, I\'m working hard to keep us all employed, you know, these are the steps that I\'m taking, these are the things that I\'m trying. But I am worried if this goes on for two months or three months. So, you know, let\'s, let\'s all think together about what we might be able to contribute in order to solve this problem, in order to stay to stay fresh. So again, everyone is in the same boat. So tell the truth about that. I think people find that comforting.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> Why going back to something you said I think applies here too Sherry is like, this is what I know. I know, that I want you to have I want us to keep going. Yeah, I don\'t know what the financial future looks like for the entire world. We just don\'t know those things and coming back to those trees. And also like the message of like, it\'s hard to say this because we can\'t physically be together. But this is our time to rally as humans and the team. Like, I don\'t know what the feature is that what I do know is I love you, I care about you. I care about your family. You know, I think those things are really good, really good words too.\n\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> You, I think, again, depending on your context, because these are very context-dependent kind of questions. But it\'s also you know, I wouldn\'t save this for every team, but it\'s okay as a leader to sort of put it back to the team and say, here are the numbers. Here\'s the work. Here\'s the timeline, like what do we want to do? Maybe people are going to say, hey, let\'s just take 25% off. Across the board will help reduce our salaries will, you know bank that money? Hopefully or, I mean, I think you can think creatively together. And again, not feel the pressure of I have to solve this for everyone. That\'s not what leadership means. Leadership means you\'re hosting the conversation. You\'re listening. you\'re engaging, it doesn\'t mean that you are the ultimate decider. You\'re not the wizard to use your term. Yeah.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> Yeah. I love that. We don\'t have to have the answer. We\'re not gonna have the answer. \n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> We can\'t. You don\'t. You can\'t. It\'s not a choice.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> We can put her my partner used to say the open hand approached open palm is like how do we? That\'s a great question. How do we figure this out? That goes for family situations too, right here. How to, hey, we\'re in this together. This is you know, if we find this rainbow in the storm cloud kind of thing is, this is forced our human race to go. We\'re in this together, even the ones that maybe don\'t even have a quote case. Have the virus, especially as to say like we are all in this together. And it\'s an opportunity for Philly, all of us to come together at this time. Che just a couple more minutes. I want people to know how to get ahold of you or resources. And before I let you say that I want to say, Sherry, thank you again, everybody. Thank her please, chat online if you feel do so on Twitter. She\'s ads and founder. But I want to mention one thing, too. She\'s got a prolific podcast. And the last podcast episode she did is called calm stability. Can you hear that in her voice, by the way, should be calm stability, calm by Sherry Wallace. But go do that she\'s got a ton of resources there particularly for entrepreneurs. Sure, how can people learn more about you and the different pieces of content? Ah, I forgot to do this Sherry. She\'s got a great book called How to keep your sh t together and I\'ll put a link to do that in the chat or somebody can put a link to that in chat, by the way, it\'s 399 on Kindle. It\'s a great resource that Sherry and her husband Rob put together just for these times. I don\'t want to miss that. But how else can we kind of keep on the Sherry? Sherry fan? Fan bank bandwagon?\n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> Yeah, you know, I think, and I\'m just really happy to do it, Cory, anything, like, like all of you, if I can find a little space of where I can offer something helpful, what an honor for me to be able to offer something helpful. And I think all of us are sort of asking, How can I be helpful. So you know, I\'m right alongside you and the rest of your team and ask him that question. I mean, the podcast, I hope is a great resource in terms of just, you know, freely available. It\'s not always perfect, but you know, we try to provide some thoughtful content that helps people navigate the storms that sort of safe all of our mental health. But yeah, if people want to reach out to me, I\'m at Sherry wall. dot com or Zen founder, comm z and founder calm so yeah,\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> I\'ll put the link in the recording. But also Lindsay\'s put the link to her book, fantastic book, a couple of recaps, I just want to say from what I heard from Sherry, from what I heard from you, my friend. We\'re in this together, a big four by four, deep, low breath, for in four seconds in four seconds out, gratitude. Find a way to play. Still, your kids like this, break out a board game, do something, find a way to play to this element of childlike joy. Exercise is a great antidote. Find a way to get your heartbeat up. Stay connected. Have your list of people that you\'re going to connect with every day, or frequently to do that as a kind of an antidote to the time that we\'re in. Sherry Thank you, please. Say hi to Rob and the kiddos. And thank you so so so much for your time. Today sharing I think this was a big deep breath for everyone and you\'re calm presence and you\'re just sharing your tips and things have helped a lot of people that I hope will keep you going and you can share these things. Practice these things actually be an example for others and reach out when we need help. So any less than this year, thanks. \n\n<p><strong>Sherry:</strong> Thanks so much and thanks for having the conversation. We\'ll have the conversation as many times as we need to tell this is a little bit better.\n\n<p><strong>Cory:</strong> Yes ma\'am. Thank you, everybody. Stay safe and healthy. mentally and physically. See you</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://otter.ai/s/yMpkP8vNRy-5Ildi4Ec82Q\">Transcription via Otter</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 01:42:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Brian Krogsgard\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: Build Custom Templates with the MB Views Add-On for Meta Box\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=97940\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:185:\"https://wptavern.com/build-custom-templates-with-the-mb-views-add-on-for-meta-box?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=build-custom-templates-with-the-mb-views-add-on-for-meta-box\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8296:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Meta Box released its <a href=\"https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-views/\">MB Views add-on plugin</a> last week. The new extension allows developers to build custom templates from the comfort of their WordPress admin. The goal is to provide an easy-to-use interface for outputting custom fields without editing theme files, but its flexibility pushes the boundaries of full-site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Quick take:</strong> MB Views offers a solid developer experience but falls a little short of being friendly for those unfamiliar with code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have long been a fan of what the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/meta-box/\">Meta Box</a> team has done with its core plugin and extensions. The project&rsquo;s developers have created a well-documented code base, written solid documentation, and have generally paid attention to details where others have failed. MB Views is no different. In minutes after activating the extension, I had custom views set up and rolled out on the front end of my test site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interface is simple enough to pick up almost immediately with enough flexibility to build nearly anything from the WordPress admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, the team&rsquo;s new add-on is well worth the price of one of the available <a href=\"https://metabox.io/pricing/\">premium bundles</a>, which range between $79 and $349. It is not without a few minor issues, but that is to be expected with a version 1.0 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Powerful Tool for Front End Editing</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Creating a custom view with the plugin&rsquo;s view editor.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">My experience working with the view-editing screen felt natural. The code editor uses <a href=\"https://codemirror.net/\">Code Mirror</a> and its Oceanic Next theme. It has auto-tabbing and auto-complete built in, so it feels like most offline editors. Developers should feel at home quickly building a custom view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I mostly use Tailwind CSS these days, I was able to build a <em>faux</em> email signup form in a couple of minutes and display it directly beneath my posts using the available view settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom-built email signup form with MB Views.\n\n\n\n<p>The code editor has a &ldquo;New Field&rdquo; button that opens a slide-out box on the right side of the screen. It allows users to insert post, site, user, and query fields. The options also include custom fields created via the Meta Box plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides editing the template, users can also add custom CSS and JavaScript directly from the view code editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The output of these fields are all handled through <a href=\"https://twig.symfony.com/\">Twig</a>, a modern PHP templating engine. Many PHP developers will already be familiar with Twig and will feel comfortable with its syntax. Through this system, plugin users are not limited to HTML. They can use conditionals and loops to customize the output of their view content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a better developer experience, it would be nice to see an auto-complete option for inserting new fields instead of clicking the &ldquo;New Field&rdquo; button and then clicking on a particular field. Most likely, developers will begin memorizing the fields over time and simply type them out. Auto-complete would be a nice touch for custom fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />View settings and conditionals.\n\n\n\n<p>Where MB Views really shines is its view settings. The plugin allows views to take over the entire page between the theme header and footer or just the content area. It allows users to choose between displaying a view on singular posts, archive pages, or something custom using its built-in shortcode. Users can further break down where a view appears based on conditions that can be grouped in various ways. It can be as simple or complex as needed. It is not completely on par with what&rsquo;s possible with custom PHP conditionals, but it is close enough to cover the majority of use cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone wanted to try their hand at it, they could use MB Views as an entire site editor. The only real requirement would be to build their theme with a header and footer. At some point, maybe the plugin will allow users to take over the entire page layout, effectively making a theme unnecessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Issues and Future Enhancements</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Version 1.0 is about shipping something into the hands of users. It is a time when developers get some of their most useful feedback, so I expect the following to be addressed as the developers continue to build upon the plugin in the future. I did not hit any major roadblocks, but I did come across some minor issues and had some ideas for improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first issue I hit made me initially believe the plugin did not work at all. I had chosen to display my custom view on singular posts. This is easy to do via the view settings. You select the &ldquo;Singular&rdquo; type. Then, select &ldquo;Post&rdquo; in the first drop-down select. I had assumed this would make the template appear on all posts. However, nothing happened after saving. None of my custom content appeared on the front end. The problem was there was a second drop-down select, which had not been populated with a value by default. There was an &ldquo;All Posts&rdquo; option I needed to select. It was a quick issue to address, but this is why good defaults are so important in plugin development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no revision support. For a code editor in the WordPress admin, it makes sense that users could revert their code to an earlier version. If users only ever create views with minor bits of code, this will be a non-issue. However, the plugin goes as far as allowing users to create an entire page layout between the theme&rsquo;s header and footer. That will sometimes mean a lot of code and the need to backpedal changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MB Views offers an <code>[mbv]</code> shortcode for outputting a view within shortcode-ready areas, such as post content. However, there is no block equivalent for use in the block editor. At this point, having a shortcode but no block seems like a major oversight. Shortcodes need to die a slow and painful death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The view management screen could use a little love too. It would be nice to see at least a column for the view type. As the list of custom views grows, it may get hard to figure out where each view is used at a glance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>User Friendliness and the Future</h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>You want to get values of Meta Box fields and put them on your front-end templates, but you&rsquo;re not too familiar with coding and don&rsquo;t want to touch theme files?</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>MB Views&rsquo; opening description claims the plugin is geared toward users who are not familiar with coding. I am unsure if the average user could take advantage of it without picking up some coding knowledge along the way. The interface is primarily geared toward developers. Quite literally, the view editor is a code editor. It does have an easy-to-click field inserter, but those fields will often be useless without some familiarity with HTML and CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tool is good at what it does, but it almost feels like a stop-gap measure in the era of the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For MB Views to be a more useful end-user tool, it will need to transition to more of a visual, point-and-click interface with design options. Otherwise, it will mostly stay in the land of developers who can customize view output to perfection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily think MB Views must go in that direction if the team wants to focus on a great developer experience. However, it does not currently live up to its claim of friendliness for those less familiar with code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are still likely at least a year out from a full-site editing experience via the block system. Efforts by the Meta Box team may be best spent integrating view editing within that system. The MB Views add-on is a useful and necessary tool for many Meta Box plugin users today, but it may not have time to gain traction before full-site editing lands in core. At that point, the plugin team will need to already be transitioning into a much different world of user experience with WordPress.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 20:35:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"HeroPress: Finding My Way With WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=3076\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:132:\"https://heropress.com/essays/finding-my-way-with-wordpress/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=finding-my-way-with-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8398:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/031620-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"WordPress Changed My Life\" /><p>Wow, HeroPress! How did I even get here? Why am I even here? I&#8217;m hardly a hero after reading so many inspiring stories.</p>\n<p>Let me tell you mine. I do this with my usual reluctance which I will explain in a bit.</p>\n<h3>The Beginning</h3>\n<p>I got started with WordPress about 10 years ago. I was having lunch with a friend (formerly a client) in Grand Central Station in New York. He, being much wiser than I, said, &#8220;Hey Bud, you ought to learn WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No way,&#8221; I objected. &#8220;I&#8217;m a code guy. I&#8217;m a &#8216;Rage Against The Machine Guy.&#8217; I&#8217;ll never use anything like that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He pleaded with me to re-consider. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. Things are changing. I&#8217;ll give you my username and password. Just login and have a look. My guy installed a bunch of plugins that you can use.&#8221;</p>\n<p>What the heck was a plugin?</p>\n<p>And so it began. I logged in. Looking back, it was WordPress 2.6. I didn&#8217;t really know what that meant.</p>\n<p>I signed up with Bluehost. I played around with lots of themes but kept coming back to Kubrick (aka TwentyTen). I religiously installed all the plugins used in my friend&#8217;s site, holding on to his railings as I began to learn WP. Then came Thematic and its &#8220;easy&#8221; introduction to what a child theme was. Once I saw that you could edit anything and make it yours, I was hooked. The endorphins were freely coursing through my veins.</p>\n<h3>Spreading The Word</h3>\n<p>Now soon after &#8211; being an instructor &#8211; I thought, &#8220;I could teach this&#8221; and so I did at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. That first class was totally by the seat of my pants. Hardly my usual MO. The syllabus was completely in my head. I pulled it off and that was a lot of fun.</p>\n<p>The classrooms were packed those first few years of teaching. WP was exploding. If you were the first kid on the block using or teaching it, you were gold.</p>\n<p>Then two big things were about to happen that were really going to change my life. They would show me the way to the WordPress community &#8211; not that I even knew what that was.</p>\n<h3>Finding Community</h3>\n<p>A student advised that I should go to the monthly WordPress MeetUp in New York City. That was in 2014. He&#8217;s long gone but I&#8217;m a regular. I have presented talks many times where we usually got about 40 people to attend. Other types of WordPress MeetUps started to take hold and I became a regular there as well.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I started going to WordCamps in NYC. Those were eye openers. This WordPress thing was getting big and there were people connected to it and each other. They were all so nice and smart and I felt at home &#8211; not that I&#8217;m always so nice and smart. In 2016 I was accepted to speak at WordCamp NYC. (It still is the only WordCamp ever held at the United Nations.) I didn&#8217;t know a soul but one of the organizers loved my presentation, &#8220;Lessons Learned: Considerations For Teaching Your Clients WordPress.&#8221; He and I became good friends as he ushered me into the New York City WordPress community.</p>\n<p>From there it was on to WordCamp US in Philadelphia and the following year in Nashville. I started meeting WordPress Royalty like <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/its-never-too-late-even-in-the-tech-community/\">BobWP</a> (aka Bob Dunn). WordCamps were starting to feel like high school reunions. In 2019 I spoke at WordCamps Boston, Montclair, and Philadelphia. Speaker wrangling became my thing. I&#8217;ll be doing it for the third and final time this year for WordCamp NYC. (That&#8217;s if all goes well given how many WordCamps have been cancelled because of COVID-19.)</p>\n<p>Somewhere in the middle of it all, I was listening to a WordPress Weekly podcast and a host, Marcus Couch, just got a gig with Smashing Magazine as their WordPress guy. He put out a call for anyone to submit an article for publication. I sent in &#8220;The Golden Age Of Web Design&#8221; and, after a few back and forths, it got turned down. Then I came up with an idea that I didn&#8217;t think they&#8217;d turn away, but I did not want to write about.</p>\n<p>I figured why not write about something that is very personal and something I was reluctant to discuss publicly. I am legally blind.</p>\n<h3>Freedom From Blindness</h3>\n<p>So &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/using-low-vision-teach-wordpress/\">Using Low Vision As My Tool To Help Me Teach WordPress</a>&#8221; was written. There was no way Smashing Mag would turn me down now, and they didn&#8217;t. In a year or so I turned that article into &#8220;My Way With WordPress,&#8221; a WordCamp talk. While I was not really interested in the subject, it seemed as if others were.</p>\n<p>But the funniest &#8211; I suppose &#8211; story was when I spoke at the first ever WordCamp Montclair in 2019. It was a presentation on Gutenberg plugins. Since I couldn&#8217;t do this from a notebook screen (the screen is too small and the keyboard is hard for me to manipulate), it was decided that I would bring (I am about to embarrass myself) my 27&#8243; iMac to a WordCamp. I&#8217;m probably the first person to ever have done this. It was good thing I only lived a few miles away.</p>\n<p>After lunch on Day One, it was my turn to present. The guys (it was a crew) spent a few minutes hooking me up to all the equipment. I sat behind my computer, did my thing, and every once in awhile peered out to make sure people were still there. While there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any pictures of this ever happening, I don&#8217;t need visual proof to remind me of this. I hear about it all the time!</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s fine with me.</p>\n<p>WordPress changed my life. It’s not just about the community but through it the sense of accomplishment I get whenever I launch a new or re-designed site. It’s also given me a great feeling to know that many people have learned WordPress around the world because of my 2 free online classes. This might just be the most gratifying thing of all.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Finding My Way With WordPress\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Finding%20My%20Way%20With%20WordPress&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Ffinding-my-way-with-wordpress%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Finding My Way With WordPress\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Ffinding-my-way-with-wordpress%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Ffinding-my-way-with-wordpress%2F&title=Finding+My+Way+With+WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Finding My Way With WordPress\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/finding-my-way-with-wordpress/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/031620-min-150x150.jpg&description=Finding My Way With WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Finding My Way With WordPress\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/finding-my-way-with-wordpress/\" title=\"Finding My Way With WordPress\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/finding-my-way-with-wordpress/\">Finding My Way With WordPress</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 08:00:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Bud Kraus\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 21:22:35 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 21:15:08 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20200318213511\";}', 'no');

Another thing is that these buses smell really bad and the drivers will just drop you off in the middle of nowhere where taxi drivers will wait.[/caption]\n\nThere are so many tours and agencies that are specialized in the tours from Hanoi to Halong Bay. In my opinion, taking a tour isn\'t very expensive and it will cost you <strong>around 200,000 dongs (around $10)</strong>, but if you want to go on the budget, then the bus is the better option.\n\nThe buses from <strong>My Dinh bus station to Halong Bay</strong> bus station costs a bit lower than 100,000 dongs. It won\'t be that significantly cheaper and I guess the value isn\'t near these private shuttles, but at least, you can have food for a day in Halong Bay for that money!\n\n<div data-gyg-href=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/default/activites.frame\" data-gyg-locale-code=\"en-US\" data-gyg-widget=\"activities\" data-gyg-number-of-items=\"3\" data-gyg-currency=\"USD\" data-gyg-partner-id=\"781AB6P\" data-gyg-q=\"Hanoi to Halong Bay\"></div><script async defer src=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js\"></script>\n\n<strong>Learn more: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam\">Cultural shocks you will experience in Vietnam (and other SEAn countries!)</a></strong>\n\nIf you\'re located somewhere outside the Old Quarter in Hanoi, the best way to go around is by taking a local bus that costs 7,000 dongs in one direction. Alternatively, I was using Grab so much which is very convenient and cheap compared to regular taxis (Uber in Vietnam).\n\nSo, if you choose to visit Halong Bay from Hanoi by bus, then I recommend you to check out their official bus schedule and site <strong><a href=\"https://vexere.com/en-US\">Vexere</a></strong> for details. It seems there is a bus line every three hours to Halong Bay, so you\'re quite flexible.\n\nThe bus ride will take around <strong>4 - 5 hours with one stop</strong> where you could take a snack or beer to refresh yourself.\n\nAlso, don\'t forget to check our complete <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/public-transportation-in-vietnam\"><strong>public transport guide about Vietnam</strong></a>. There are some golden tips that can save you time and money while traveling around the country.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1142\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"540\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1142 size-full\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/29547340_950182591824639_1956733929_n-1.jpg\" alt=\"Bia Hanoi in the country side\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /> A local beer from Ha Noi is always a good choice to refresh yourself on the bus stops![/caption]\n\n<strong><em>Note:</em> </strong>The bus isn\'t the most comfortable one and it smells pretty bad, but at least you\'ll get an authentic experience and a few bucks saved! :)\n\n<strong><em>Note 2:</em> </strong>Don\'t get scammed by a bus driver who will tell you to get outside the bus before the station. They will leave you in the middle of nowhere on the main road and that place will be overcrowded by taxi drivers. That\'s a nice way to make some money! But again, it\'s very easy to bargain! Never ever accept the first price, especially from taxi drivers as they will usually change their mind pretty fast!\n\nWhen I was traveling back to Hanoi, I took another bus which was kind of VIP with one stop on the market. The bus was very nice and comfortable with only a few passengers and the trip lasted around 4 hours. The price was 100,000 dongs and pay attention to the type of the bus (<strong>look for VIP buses</strong>).\n<h2><strong>Best Time to Climb Bai Tho Mountain</strong></h2>\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1158 size-large\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC05214-1024x681.jpg\" alt=\"Halong Bay in March\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" />\n\nWell, if you\'re looking for good weather and you don\'t want to share this beautiful wonder with millions of tourists, the best seasons tend to be <strong>Spring (March and April) and Fall (September, October).</strong>\n\nI visited it at the end of the March and it seems like a perfect time as the weather was pretty nice, there weren\'t many tourists around and prices were just a bit higher than in Hanoi. You can experience temperatures around <strong>20 - 25C in March</strong> which is completely fine if you ask me. I just wanted to add the fact that a visit to Halong Bay was just a few days after I left cold and snowy Croatia!\n\nWe climbed Bai Tho mountain twice, to watch a sunset and sunrise. Sunset was a bit misty and foggy which makes a trail a bit slippery, so be careful! When it comes to sunrise, it\'s extremely clear without many clouds and you can see thousands of limestones in the bay!\n\nWhen it comes to food, drinks, and accommodation, I was astonished by our hostel price that was only <strong>300,000 dongs (around $13) per night</strong>. The hostel was located on the main street and we had the luck to be on the fifth floor overlooking an infinite number of limestones!\n\nFood was a bit pricier than in Hanoi and the portions weren\'t so significant. I mainly ate their Banh Mi and Pho. For a can of beer in the town, expect to pay around 30,000 dongs (around $1.3).\n\nAnyway, during the stay, I can\'t say anything was overpriced or I experienced hordes of tourists, but I noticed <strong>slightly higher prices compared to Hanoi</strong> which shouldn\'t hurt your wallet that much.\n<h2><strong>How to Find and Climb Bai Tho Mountain</strong></h2>\n[caption id=\"attachment_1145\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1145 size-large\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC05533-1024x681.jpg\" alt=\"Alternative way to experience Ha Long Bay\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" /> Well, before I did any planning, I was told by so many people to take a boat tour and that would be the best way to experience Halong Bay. At first, I was thinking of getting on a tour, but after some research, I find out that it\'s usually overcrowded and you don\'t get the value for the money you pay.[/caption]\n\n<em>The last thing I wanted was sharing the boat with hundreds of tourists!</em>\n\nLuckily, on my arrival in Hanoi, I met an amazing guy Bryan from the Philippines and we shared a similar opinion when it comes to the way of traveling - we were looking for memorable experiences.\n\nWe headed to Halong Bay absolutely not having an idea what to do and see. We only knew that we were heading to a breathtaking natural wonder.\n\nBefore we arrived, Bryan stumbled upon a post on Instagram from one upcoming travel blogger with the alternative view on Halong Bay. We instantly agreed that we\'re going there!\n\nThe place is called <strong>Bai Tho Mountain</strong> (the view really gives you much inspiration!).\n\n<em>See on the map below how to find the mountain:</em>\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d14904.62690776757!2d107.0788694!3d20.9462203!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0xe60e88af13062a43!2sPoem+Mountain!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1553428679934\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nIt\'s amazing that this mountain is located in the residual area, but it\'s not a very known place as there is no signs or nothing that could tell you where and how to climb it!\n\n<em>Here comes the most interesting part...</em>\n\nYou need to navigate the doors of the local house and you basically walk through their house (very warm people) to set your feet on the hiking trail that will lead you to the top.\n\nIf you thought you would pass through someone\'s house for free, you\'d be very wrong! We\'re in Vietnam baby! The funny thing is that when these locals show you the way to their backyard, they will start to wave with <em>50,000 dongs</em> which mean <strong><em>\"Give me 50k to climb!\".</em></strong>\n\n<em><strong>Note: </strong></em>Later, we found out that there is a house on the left and the owners will let you through for 25k! :)\n\nWe went there twice to catch the sunset and sunrise. The sunrise absolutely blew away our minds and the most interesting thing is that only four people in total were there catching the sunrise. It means a whole Halong Bay for us for only $2! :)\n\n<em>Alright, now then you have a location and know the details, I bet it\'s time for pictures to show you how that hike and view actually looked alike! </em>\n\nIf you\'re looking for more stunning adventures and don\'t want to share the place with thousands of tourists, we advise you to check the <a href=\"https://www.asabbatical.com/article/visit-ha-long-bay\"><strong>most breathtaking bays in Vietnam</strong></a>.\n\n<hr />\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1146\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1146 size-large\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_5947-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Bai Tho mountain from the street\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /> You need to climb to the top of that limestone, but don\'t worry, the hike isn\'t that tough.

And not to forget, it only costs $13 for a double room.[/caption]\n\nThere are many options to stay in Halong Bay, especially when tourists start to arrive (<strong>around May</strong>). I went for a budget option again, renting a hostel on the main street in Halong Bay city.\n\nThe name of the hostel is Halong Bay View Hostel and it acts as a backpacker hub there. The hostel has a small pub with billiards and a restaurant where you could order a coffee, tea or western food.\n\n<strong>Budget advice: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget\">Traveling around Vietnam on $20 per day!</a></strong>\n\nThe coffee is decent, but I make better sandwiches then they serve there, so my genuine advice is not to eat there (sorry guys!).\n\nI had luck to have a room on the fifth floor with a huge balcony. The room had everything needed and it was clean.\n\nThe funniest thing was that in Hanoi I slept on a very hard mattress that feels like you\'re sleeping on the floor and I was so happy to finally sleep on a REAL bed, but only slept three hours there! The urge to catch the sunrise on Halong Bay was much stronger than the comfort of the bed this time!\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1144\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1144 size-large\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/29526678_950182308491334_2026605498_o-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Ha Long Backpacker hostel\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /> A view of the hostel from the street. It has a bar and breakfast included in the price. The breakfast is nothing special, but still, any food is better than no food! :)[/caption]\n\nI was so amazed by the view I had from the room. Literally, you could see Halong Bay from the balcony drinking a beer! Also, the price was surprisingly low and it <strong>costs only $13 for a night</strong> in two-bedroom with breakfast included.\n\nHowever, as I find out later from a German girl, it wasn\'t that cheap as she paid around $20 for a night in a nice hotel room with two beds. But anyway, six dollars won\'t be that hard on your wallet!\n\n<hr />\n\nHope you enjoyed and if you have any additional questions, feel free to reach us out through<strong> <a href=\"http://balkandigitalnomads.com/contact/\">contact form</a></strong> or directly on social media!\n\nCheers, and wish you an amazing experience in Halong Bay! :\n\nbtw. are you looking for your next destination after stunning Halong Bay?

It won\'t be that significantly cheaper and I guess the value isn\'t near these private shuttles, but at least, you can have food for a day in Halong Bay for that money!\n\n<div data-gyg-href=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/default/activites.frame\" data-gyg-locale-code=\"en-US\" data-gyg-widget=\"activities\" data-gyg-number-of-items=\"3\" data-gyg-currency=\"USD\" data-gyg-partner-id=\"781AB6P\" data-gyg-q=\"Hanoi to Halong Bay\"></div><script async defer src=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js\"></script>\n\n<strong>Learn more: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam\">Cultural shocks you will experience in Vietnam (and other SEAn countries!)</a></strong>\n\nIf you\'re located somewhere outside the Old Quarter in Hanoi, the best way to go around is by taking a local bus that costs 7,000 dongs in one direction. Alternatively, I was using Grab so much which is very convenient and cheap compared to regular taxis (Uber in Vietnam).\n\nSo, if you choose to visit Halong Bay from Hanoi by bus, then I recommend you to check out their official bus schedule and site <strong><a href=\"https://vexere.com/en-US\">Vexere</a></strong> for details. It seems there is a bus line every three hours to Halong Bay, so you\'re quite flexible.\n\nThe bus ride will take around <strong>4 - 5 hours with one stop</strong> where you could take a snack or beer to refresh yourself.\n\nAlso, don\'t forget to check our complete <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/public-transportation-in-vietnam\"><strong>public transport guide about Vietnam</strong></a>. There are some golden tips that can save you time and money while traveling around the country.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1142\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"540\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1142 size-full\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/29547340_950182591824639_1956733929_n-1.jpg\" alt=\"Bia Hanoi in the country side\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /> A local beer from Ha Noi is always a good choice to refresh yourself on the bus stops![/caption]\n\n<strong><em>Note:</em> </strong>The bus isn\'t the most comfortable one and it smells pretty bad, but at least you\'ll get an authentic experience and a few bucks saved! :)\n\n<strong><em>Note 2:</em> </strong>Don\'t get scammed by a bus driver who will tell you to get outside the bus before the station. They will leave you in the middle of nowhere on the main road and that place will be overcrowded by taxi drivers. That\'s a nice way to make some money! But again, it\'s very easy to bargain! Never ever accept the first price, especially from taxi drivers as they will usually change their mind pretty fast!\n\nWhen I was traveling back to Hanoi, I took another bus which was kind of VIP with one stop on the market. The bus was very nice and comfortable with only a few passengers and the trip lasted around 4 hours. The price was 100,000 dongs and pay attention to the type of the bus (<strong>look for VIP buses</strong>).\n<h2><strong>Best Time to Climb Bai Tho Mountain</strong></h2>\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1158 size-large\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC05214-1024x681.jpg\" alt=\"Halong Bay in March\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" />\n\nWell, if you\'re looking for good weather and you don\'t want to share this beautiful wonder with millions of tourists, the best seasons tend to be <strong>Spring (March and April) and Fall (September, October).</strong>\n\nI visited it at the end of the March and it seems like a perfect time as the weather was pretty nice, there weren\'t many tourists around and prices were just a bit higher than in Hanoi. You can experience temperatures around <strong>20 - 25C in March</strong> which is completely fine if you ask me. I just wanted to add the fact that a visit to Halong Bay was just a few days after I left cold and snowy Croatia!\n\nWe climbed Bai Tho mountain twice, to watch a sunset and sunrise. Sunset was a bit misty and foggy which makes a trail a bit slippery, so be careful! When it comes to sunrise, it\'s extremely clear without many clouds and you can see thousands of limestones in the bay!\n\nWhen it comes to food, drinks, and accommodation, I was astonished by our hostel price that was only <strong>300,000 dongs (around $13) per night</strong>. The hostel was located on the main street and we had the luck to be on the fifth floor overlooking an infinite number of limestones!\n\nFood was a bit pricier than in Hanoi and the portions weren\'t so significant. I mainly ate their Banh Mi and Pho. For a can of beer in the town, expect to pay around 30,000 dongs (around $1.3).\n\nAnyway, during the stay, I can\'t say anything was overpriced or I experienced hordes of tourists, but I noticed <strong>slightly higher prices compared to Hanoi</strong> which shouldn\'t hurt your wallet that much.\n<h2><strong>How to Find and Climb Bai Tho Mountain</strong></h2>\n[caption id=\"attachment_1145\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1145 size-large\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DSC05533-1024x681.jpg\" alt=\"Alternative way to experience Ha Long Bay\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" /> Well, before I did any planning, I was told by so many people to take a boat tour and that would be the best way to experience Halong Bay. At first, I was thinking of getting on a tour, but after some research, I find out that it\'s usually overcrowded and you don\'t get the value for the money you pay.[/caption]\n\n<em>The last thing I wanted was sharing the boat with hundreds of tourists!</em>\n\nLuckily, on my arrival in Hanoi, I met an amazing guy Bryan from the Philippines and we shared a similar opinion when it comes to the way of traveling - we were looking for memorable experiences.\n\nWe headed to Halong Bay absolutely not having an idea what to do and see. We only knew that we were heading to a breathtaking natural wonder.\n\nBefore we arrived, Bryan stumbled upon a post on Instagram from one upcoming travel blogger with the alternative view on Halong Bay. We instantly agreed that we\'re going there!\n\nThe place is called <strong>Bai Tho Mountain</strong> (the view really gives you much inspiration!).\n\n<em>See on the map below how to find the mountain:</em>\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d14904.62690776757!2d107.0788694!3d20.9462203!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0xe60e88af13062a43!2sPoem+Mountain!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1553428679934\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nIt\'s amazing that this mountain is located in the residual area, but it\'s not a very known place as there is no signs or nothing that could tell you where and how to climb it!\n\n<em>Here comes the most interesting part...</em>\n\nYou need to navigate the doors of the local house and you basically walk through their house (very warm people) to set your feet on the hiking trail that will lead you to the top.\n\nIf you thought you would pass through someone\'s house for free, you\'d be very wrong! We\'re in Vietnam baby! The funny thing is that when these locals show you the way to their backyard, they will start to wave with <em>50,000 dongs</em> which mean <strong><em>\"Give me 50k to climb!\".</em></strong>\n\n<em><strong>Note: </strong></em>Later, we found out that there is a house on the left and the owners will let you through for 25k! :)\n\nWe went there twice to catch the sunset and sunrise. The sunrise absolutely blew away our minds and the most interesting thing is that only four people in total were there catching the sunrise. It means a whole Halong Bay for us for only $2! :)\n\n<em>Alright, now then you have a location and know the details, I bet it\'s time for pictures to show you how that hike and view actually looked alike! </em>\n\nIf you\'re looking for more stunning adventures and don\'t want to share the place with thousands of tourists, we advise you to check the <a href=\"https://www.asabbatical.com/article/visit-ha-long-bay\"><strong>most breathtaking bays in Vietnam</strong></a>.\n\n<hr />\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1146\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1146 size-large\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_5947-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Bai Tho mountain from the street\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /> You need to climb to the top of that limestone, but don\'t worry, the hike isn\'t that tough.

And not to forget, it only costs $13 for a double room.[/caption]\n\nThere are many options to stay in Halong Bay, especially when tourists start to arrive (<strong>around May</strong>). I went for a budget option again, renting a hostel on the main street in Halong Bay city.\n\nThe name of the hostel is Halong Bay View Hostel and it acts as a backpacker hub there. The hostel has a small pub with billiards and a restaurant where you could order a coffee, tea or western food.\n\n<strong>Budget advice: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget\">Traveling around Vietnam on $20 per day!</a></strong>\n\nThe coffee is decent, but I make better sandwiches then they serve there, so my genuine advice is not to eat there (sorry guys!).\n\nI had luck to have a room on the fifth floor with a huge balcony. The room had everything needed and it was clean.\n\nThe funniest thing was that in Hanoi I slept on a very hard mattress that feels like you\'re sleeping on the floor and I was so happy to finally sleep on a REAL bed, but only slept three hours there! The urge to catch the sunrise on Halong Bay was much stronger than the comfort of the bed this time!\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1144\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1144 size-large\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/29526678_950182308491334_2026605498_o-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Ha Long Backpacker hostel\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /> A view of the hostel from the street. It has a bar and breakfast included in the price. The breakfast is nothing special, but still, any food is better than no food! :)[/caption]\n\nI was so amazed by the view I had from the room. Literally, you could see Halong Bay from the balcony drinking a beer! Also, the price was surprisingly low and it <strong>costs only $13 for a night</strong> in two-bedroom with breakfast included.\n\nHowever, as I find out later from a German girl, it wasn\'t that cheap as she paid around $20 for a night in a nice hotel room with two beds. But anyway, six dollars won\'t be that hard on your wallet!\n\n<hr />\n\nHope you enjoyed and if you have any additional questions, feel free to reach us out through<strong> <a href=\"http://balkandigitalnomads.com/contact/\">contact form</a></strong> or directly on social media!\n\nCheers, and wish you an amazing experience in Halong Bay! :\n\nbtw. are you looking for your next destination after stunning Halong Bay?

One of the first things I noticed was the way Vietnamese respect their coffee breaks. Their culture is so strong as well as their coffee and they have so many different coffees to try! Such an amazing country if you love your coffee strong and diverse!\n\nOne of the easiest, but very tasty and strong coffee to prepare is a Vietnamese drip coffee. When you walk around the city, you can see people sitting on their tiny chairs and sipping their coffee. Almost every home has the equipment for making a tasty drip coffee.\n\nWhen I tried it the first time, I immediately got hooked and now I\'m the part of their coffee culture - drinking a few strong coffees per day, no matter the time.\n\nNo matter where you\'re in the world, you should get ingredients and equipment, so you could be always ready for one shot of Vietnamese coffee! Also, it\'s easy to get your hands on the filter and it\'s highly portable as dimensions are very small. It makes a coffee filter and coffee the portable and delicious <strong><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/souvenirs-from-vietnam\">Vietnamese souvenir</a></strong> you should bring home.\n<h2><strong>Vietnamese Coffee Culture Is So Strong!</strong></h2>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1131\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vietnamese-coffee-culutre-1024x668.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnamese drip coffee culture\" width=\"1024\" height=\"668\" />\n\nYou may ask why Vietnamese people have such a strong culture and variety when it comes to coffee.\n\nWell, if we look a bit in the history, it\'s not a strange thing why <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-coffee-culture\">Vietnamese culture is revolving around the coffee</a>. The country is the second producer of coffee in the world!\n\nAs the country was a French colony, it was brought to Vietnam <a href=\"https://vina.com/cafe/\">during the 19th century</a> and since then, the government focuses so much effort on producing more and more.\n\nRight now, Vietnam is producing a whopping <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25811724\">2 million tons annually</a> and the number is growing with each year.\n\nVietnamese people usually lead a laid-back lifestyle which means many coffee breaks. It\'s not a coincidence to see them on the street or coffee shops enjoying their coffee, no matter of the time.\n\n<strong>Expand your knowledge: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam\">Learn about Vietnamese culture!</a></strong>\n\nIt was a really funny experience when I saw many small chairs set up on the street with Vietnamese people sitting on them while enjoying their coffee. And yeah, it was night time already.\n\nThey have so many different options when it comes to coffee and it\'s really hard to choose. I rarely drank bad coffee there.\n\nI tried a regular drip coffee (iced and hot), coffee with condensed milk (their regular one), coconut coffee, yogurt coffee and strongest black coffee I\'ve ever had.\n\n<strong>Each one of these blew me away, but still, I really stick to drip coffee for various reasons:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>our host family has the equipment at home, so it\'s easy and convenient to brew it.</li>\n 	<li>the whole process takes around <strong>10 minutes</strong> (they really love to take your time on every action they do).</li>\n 	<li>it\'s tasty, strong and keeps you alert and awake!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How to Brew Vietnamese Drip Coffee At Home?</strong></h2>\nMaybe it sounds complicated as there is a whole process behind it, but believe me, once you get used to it, it just becomes a nice routine!\n\nSo, I will share with you the process of making a Vietnamese black coffee with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_milk\">condensed milk</a>. You could add ice or leave it black.\n\nAnyway, if you\'re a coffee addict, you will definitely fall in love with this coffee and the whole process of preparation.\n\n<em>Let\'s start!</em>\n<h3>1. Pick the right coffee beans and brand of coffee</h3>\nI\'m not sure about the coffee around the world, but in Vietnam, I\'m using <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Trung-Nguyen-Vietnamese-coffee-can/dp/B000F17AKC/?tag=calisequipzon-20\">Trung Nguyen coffee</a>. Many people tell amazing things about this coffee and I think it\'s not a coincidence that you can find a bag of these beans in every household.\n\nIf you\'re not in Vietnam, then my advice is to try to get that coffee brand online. <em>Don\'t worry if you can\'t get it as there are many alternatives:</em>\n<ul>\n 	<li>use any dark roast coffee</li>\n 	<li>medium coarse ground coffee will do just fine</li>\n 	<li>any Robusta brand will make the work</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1132\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_6278-e1541324921612-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Trung Nguyen coffee brand in Vietnam\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" /></h3>\n<h3>2. Make sure that you have the equipment (Phins)</h3>\nOnce you get your hands on the perfect coffee, it\'s time to find the right equipment that will help you in brewing the ideal coffee.\n\nIn Vietnam, it\'s called a <em>Phin</em> and it refers to a small metal cup, filter and lid. You put these three on the top of the cup and simply wait. You can literally see each drip dropping down in your cup while enjoying your time.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1133\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_6050-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Coffee phin and other equipment for Vietnamese coffee\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nIt\'s very easy to get Vietnamese coffee filter and I recommend you to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Vietnamese-Coffee-Filter-Gravity-Insert/dp/B01AK11S7C/?tag=calisequipzon-20\">check this one</a>!\n<h3><strong>3. Preparation process</strong></h3>\nOnce you have a coffee, Phin and filter, you\'re ready to brew your first Vietnamese coffee at home!\n\nIt will take around 10 minutes, but don\'t worry, Vietnamese love to do everything slowly. Just enjoy and relax a bit, it\'s good for your health!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1134\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_6054-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Phin filled with delicious coffee\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nFirst, fill the Phin with a desired amount of coffee. I usually put around 4 small spoons, but you can do even more.

One of the first things I noticed was the way Vietnamese respect their coffee breaks. Their culture is so strong as well as their coffee and they have so many different coffees to try! Such an amazing country if you love your coffee strong and diverse!\n\nOne of the easiest, but very tasty and strong coffee to prepare is a Vietnamese drip coffee. When you walk around the city, you can see people sitting on their tiny chairs and sipping their coffee. Almost every home has the equipment for making a tasty drip coffee.\n\nWhen I tried it the first time, I immediately got hooked and now I\'m the part of their coffee culture - drinking a few strong coffees per day, no matter the time.\n\nNo matter where you\'re in the world, you should get ingredients and equipment, so you could be always ready for one shot of Vietnamese coffee! Also, it\'s easy to get your hands on the filter and it\'s highly portable as dimensions are very small. It makes a coffee filter and coffee the portable and delicious <strong><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/souvenirs-from-vietnam\">Vietnamese souvenir</a></strong> you should bring home.\n<h2><strong>Vietnamese Coffee Culture Is So Strong!</strong></h2>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1131\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vietnamese-coffee-culutre-1024x668.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnamese drip coffee culture\" width=\"1024\" height=\"668\" />\n\nYou may ask why Vietnamese people have such a strong culture and variety when it comes to coffee.\n\nWell, if we look a bit in the history, it\'s not a strange thing why <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-coffee-culture\">Vietnamese culture is revolving around the coffee</a>. The country is the second producer of coffee in the world!\n\nAs the country was a French colony, it was brought to Vietnam <a href=\"https://vina.com/cafe/\">during the 19th century</a> and since then, the government focuses so much effort on producing more and more.\n\nRight now, Vietnam is producing a whopping <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25811724\">2 million tons annually</a> and the number is growing with each year.\n\nVietnamese people usually lead a laid-back lifestyle which means many coffee breaks. It\'s not a coincidence to see them on the street or coffee shops enjoying their coffee, no matter of the time.\n\n<strong>Expand your knowledge: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam\">Learn about Vietnamese culture!</a></strong>\n\nIt was a really funny experience when I saw many small chairs set up on the street with Vietnamese people sitting on them while enjoying their coffee. And yeah, it was night time already.\n\nThey have so many different options when it comes to coffee and it\'s really hard to choose. I rarely drank bad coffee there.\n\nI tried a regular drip coffee (iced and hot), coffee with condensed milk (their regular one), coconut coffee, yogurt coffee and strongest black coffee I\'ve ever had.\n\n<strong>Each one of these blew me away, but still, I really stick to drip coffee for various reasons:</strong>\n<ul>\n 	<li>our host family has the equipment at home, so it\'s easy and convenient to brew it.</li>\n 	<li>the whole process takes around <strong>10 minutes</strong> (they really love to take your time on every action they do).</li>\n 	<li>it\'s tasty, strong and keeps you alert and awake!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How to Brew Vietnamese Drip Coffee At Home?</strong></h2>\nMaybe it sounds complicated as there is a whole process behind it, but believe me, once you get used to it, it just becomes a nice routine!\n\nSo, I will share with you the process of making a Vietnamese black coffee with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_milk\">condensed milk</a>. You could add ice or leave it black.\n\nAnyway, if you\'re a coffee addict, you will definitely fall in love with this coffee and the whole process of preparation.\n\n<em>Let\'s start!</em>\n<h3>1. Pick the right coffee beans and brand of coffee</h3>\nI\'m not sure about the coffee around the world, but in Vietnam, I\'m using <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Trung-Nguyen-Vietnamese-coffee-can/dp/B000F17AKC/?tag=calisequipzon-20\">Trung Nguyen coffee</a>. Many people tell amazing things about this coffee and I think it\'s not a coincidence that you can find a bag of these beans in every household.\n\nIf you\'re not in Vietnam, then my advice is to try to get that coffee brand online. <em>Don\'t worry if you can\'t get it as there are many alternatives:</em>\n<ul>\n 	<li>use any dark roast coffee</li>\n 	<li>medium coarse ground coffee will do just fine</li>\n 	<li>any Robusta brand will make the work</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1132\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_6278-e1541324921612-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Trung Nguyen coffee brand in Vietnam\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" /></h3>\n<h3>2. Make sure that you have the equipment (Phins)</h3>\nOnce you get your hands on the perfect coffee, it\'s time to find the right equipment that will help you in brewing the ideal coffee.\n\nIn Vietnam, it\'s called a <em>Phin</em> and it refers to a small metal cup, filter and lid. You put these three on the top of the cup and simply wait. You can literally see each drip dropping down in your cup while enjoying your time.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1133\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_6050-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Coffee phin and other equipment for Vietnamese coffee\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nIt\'s very easy to get Vietnamese coffee filter and I recommend you to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Vietnamese-Coffee-Filter-Gravity-Insert/dp/B01AK11S7C/?tag=calisequipzon-20\">check this one</a>!\n<h3><strong>3. Preparation process</strong></h3>\nOnce you have a coffee, Phin and filter, you\'re ready to brew your first Vietnamese coffee at home!\n\nIt will take around 10 minutes, but don\'t worry, Vietnamese love to do everything slowly. Just enjoy and relax a bit, it\'s good for your health!\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1134\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_6054-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Phin filled with delicious coffee\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nFirst, fill the Phin with a desired amount of coffee. I usually put around 4 small spoons, but you can do even more. Vietnamese people usually fill more than half of the Phin!\n<p id=\"PJxWxmg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-752 aligncenter\" src=\"http://balkandigitalnomads.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ac72de50e132.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\nPut the Phin at the top of the glass/cup.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1135\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_6060-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Put the filter in the phin.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nOnce you put a desired amount of coffee inside a Phin, just put the filter on top.\n\n<em><strong>You\'re ready for the showtime now!</strong></em>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1136\" src=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_6062-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Process of making Vietnamese traditional coffee\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nFill the Phin with boiled water, sit back and relax while every drop of tasty coffee is dropping down to your cup.

If you\'re somehow like me, a person who loves to experience beautiful places, but doesn\'t want to be around a hundred tourists in small boat tour, then this article is for you!  I was wondering if there is any way to have Halong Bay only for myself. If you add a small budget to that equation, it seems like an impossible thing, but better, believe me, I found a way and it\'s called Bai Tho mountain!  <em>Keep reading as I will provide you with the guide to experience Halong Bay on a shoestring budget:</em> <h2><strong>Hanoi to Halong Bay by Bus </strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-1141 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.29341646_950182588491306_1156950490_n.jpg\" alt=\"Never ending bus ride to Ha Long Bay\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The ride on the normal bus (referring to the bus that is not a sleeper bus) is very tough and uncomfortable. Usually, it\'s a bit overcrowded and people are sitting on the way between the seats. Another thing is that these buses smell really bad and the drivers will just drop you off in the middle of nowhere where taxi drivers will wait.</div>  There are so many tours and agencies that are specialized in the tours from Hanoi to Halong Bay. In my opinion, taking a tour isn\'t very expensive and it will cost you <strong>around 200,000 dongs (around $10)</strong>, but if you want to go on the budget, then the bus is the better option.  The buses from <strong>My Dinh bus station to Halong Bay</strong> bus station costs a bit lower than 100,000 dongs. It won\'t be that significantly cheaper and I guess the value isn\'t near these private shuttles, but at least, you can have food for a day in Halong Bay for that money!  <div data-gyg-href=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/default/activites.frame\" data-gyg-locale-code=\"en-US\" data-gyg-widget=\"activities\" data-gyg-number-of-items=\"3\" data-gyg-currency=\"USD\" data-gyg-partner-id=\"781AB6P\" data-gyg-q=\"Hanoi to Halong Bay\"></div><script async defer src=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js\"></script>  <strong>Learn more: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam\">Cultural shocks you will experience in Vietnam (and other SEAn countries!)</a></strong>  If you\'re located somewhere outside the Old Quarter in Hanoi, the best way to go around is by taking a local bus that costs 7,000 dongs in one direction. Alternatively, I was using Grab so much which is very convenient and cheap compared to regular taxis (Uber in Vietnam).  So, if you choose to visit Halong Bay from Hanoi by bus, then I recommend you to check out their official bus schedule and site <strong><a href=\"https://vexere.com/en-US\">Vexere</a></strong> for details. It seems there is a bus line every three hours to Halong Bay, so you\'re quite flexible.  The bus ride will take around <strong>4 - 5 hours with one stop</strong> where you could take a snack or beer to refresh yourself.  Also, don\'t forget to check our complete <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/public-transportation-in-vietnam\"><strong>public transport guide about Vietnam</strong></a>. There are some golden tips that can save you time and money while traveling around the country.  <img class=\"wp-image-1142 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.29547340_950182591824639_1956733929_n-1.jpg\" alt=\"Bia Hanoi in the country side\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A local beer from Ha Noi is always a good choice to refresh yourself on the bus stops!</div>  <strong><em>Note:</em> </strong>The bus isn\'t the most comfortable one and it smells pretty bad, but at least you\'ll get an authentic experience and a few bucks saved! :)  <strong><em>Note 2:</em> </strong>Don\'t get scammed by a bus driver who will tell you to get outside the bus before the station. They will leave you in the middle of nowhere on the main road and that place will be overcrowded by taxi drivers. That\'s a nice way to make some money! But again, it\'s very easy to bargain! Never ever accept the first price, especially from taxi drivers as they will usually change their mind pretty fast!  When I was traveling back to Hanoi, I took another bus which was kind of VIP with one stop on the market. The bus was very nice and comfortable with only a few passengers and the trip lasted around 4 hours. The price was 100,000 dongs and pay attention to the type of the bus (<strong>look for VIP buses</strong>). <h2><strong>Best Time to Climb Bai Tho Mountain</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1158 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC05214.jpg\" alt=\"Halong Bay in March\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" />  Well, if you\'re looking for good weather and you don\'t want to share this beautiful wonder with millions of tourists, the best seasons tend to be <strong>Spring (March and April) and Fall (September, October).</strong>  I visited it at the end of the March and it seems like a perfect time as the weather was pretty nice, there weren\'t many tourists around and prices were just a bit higher than in Hanoi. You can experience temperatures around <strong>20 - 25C in March</strong> which is completely fine if you ask me. I just wanted to add the fact that a visit to Halong Bay was just a few days after I left cold and snowy Croatia!  We climbed Bai Tho mountain twice, to watch a sunset and sunrise. Sunset was a bit misty and foggy which makes a trail a bit slippery, so be careful! When it comes to sunrise, it\'s extremely clear without many clouds and you can see thousands of limestones in the bay!  When it comes to food, drinks, and accommodation, I was astonished by our hostel price that was only <strong>300,000 dongs (around $13) per night</strong>. The hostel was located on the main street and we had the luck to be on the fifth floor overlooking an infinite number of limestones!  Food was a bit pricier than in Hanoi and the portions weren\'t so significant. I mainly ate their Banh Mi and Pho. For a can of beer in the town, expect to pay around 30,000 dongs (around $1.3).  Anyway, during the stay, I can\'t say anything was overpriced or I experienced hordes of tourists, but I noticed <strong>slightly higher prices compared to Hanoi</strong> which shouldn\'t hurt your wallet that much. <h2><strong>How to Find and Climb Bai Tho Mountain</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-1145 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC05533.jpg\" alt=\"Alternative way to experience Ha Long Bay\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Well, before I did any planning, I was told by so many people to take a boat tour and that would be the best way to experience Halong Bay. At first, I was thinking of getting on a tour, but after some research, I find out that it\'s usually overcrowded and you don\'t get the value for the money you pay.</div>  <em>The last thing I wanted was sharing the boat with hundreds of tourists!</em>  Luckily, on my arrival in Hanoi, I met an amazing guy Bryan from the Philippines and we shared a similar opinion when it comes to the way of traveling - we were looking for memorable experiences.  We headed to Halong Bay absolutely not having an idea what to do and see. We only knew that we were heading to a breathtaking natural wonder.  Before we arrived, Bryan stumbled upon a post on Instagram from one upcoming travel blogger with the alternative view on Halong Bay. We instantly agreed that we\'re going there!  The place is called <strong>Bai Tho Mountain</strong> (the view really gives you much inspiration!).  <em>See on the map below how to find the mountain:</em>  <iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d14904.62690776757!2d107.0788694!3d20.9462203!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0xe60e88af13062a43!2sPoem+Mountain!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1553428679934\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>  It\'s amazing that this mountain is located in the residual area, but it\'s not a very known place as there is no signs or nothing that could tell you where and how to climb it!  <em>Here comes the most interesting part...</em>  You need to navigate the doors of the local house and you basically walk through their house (very warm people) to set your feet on the hiking trail that will lead you to the top.  If you thought you would pass through someone\'s house for free, you\'d be very wrong! We\'re in Vietnam baby! The funny thing is that when these locals show you the way to their backyard, they will start to wave with <em>50,000 dongs</em> which mean <strong><em>\"Give me 50k to climb!\".</em></strong>  <em><strong>Note: </strong></em>Later, we found out that there is a house on the left and the owners will let you through for 25k! :)  We went there twice to catch the sunset and sunrise. The sunrise absolutely blew away our minds and the most interesting thing is that only four people in total were there catching the sunrise. It means a whole Halong Bay for us for only $2! :)  <em>Alright, now then you have a location and know the details, I bet it\'s time for pictures to show you how that hike and view actually looked alike! </em>  If you\'re looking for more stunning adventures and don\'t want to share the place with thousands of tourists, we advise you to check the <a href=\"https://www.asabbatical.com/article/visit-ha-long-bay\"><strong>most breathtaking bays in Vietnam</strong></a>.  <hr />  <img class=\"wp-image-1146 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_5947.jpg\" alt=\"Bai Tho mountain from the street\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> You need to climb to the top of that limestone, but don\'t worry, the hike isn\'t that tough.

Always ask for the fifth floor as you will have a huge balcony for yourself with the view like this! And not to forget, it only costs $13 for a double room.</div>  There are many options to stay in Halong Bay, especially when tourists start to arrive (<strong>around May</strong>). I went for a budget option again, renting a hostel on the main street in Halong Bay city.  The name of the hostel is Halong Bay View Hostel and it acts as a backpacker hub there. The hostel has a small pub with billiards and a restaurant where you could order a coffee, tea or western food.  <strong>Budget advice: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget\">Traveling around Vietnam on $20 per day!</a></strong>  The coffee is decent, but I make better sandwiches then they serve there, so my genuine advice is not to eat there (sorry guys!).  I had luck to have a room on the fifth floor with a huge balcony. The room had everything needed and it was clean.  The funniest thing was that in Hanoi I slept on a very hard mattress that feels like you\'re sleeping on the floor and I was so happy to finally sleep on a REAL bed, but only slept three hours there! The urge to catch the sunrise on Halong Bay was much stronger than the comfort of the bed this time!  <img class=\"wp-image-1144 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.29526678_950182308491334_2026605498_o.jpg\" alt=\"Ha Long Backpacker hostel\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A view of the hostel from the street. It has a bar and breakfast included in the price. The breakfast is nothing special, but still, any food is better than no food! :)</div>  I was so amazed by the view I had from the room. Literally, you could see Halong Bay from the balcony drinking a beer! Also, the price was surprisingly low and it <strong>costs only $13 for a night</strong> in two-bedroom with breakfast included.  However, as I find out later from a German girl, it wasn\'t that cheap as she paid around $20 for a night in a nice hotel room with two beds. But anyway, six dollars won\'t be that hard on your wallet!  <hr />  Hope you enjoyed and if you have any additional questions, feel free to reach us out through<strong> <a href=\"http://balkandigitalnomads.com/contact/\">contact form</a></strong> or directly on social media!

(12699, 3, '2018-04-06 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'For true coffee lovers, Vietnam will be just an ideal destination. One of the first things I noticed was the way Vietnamese respect their coffee breaks. Their culture is so strong as well as their coffee and they have so many different coffees to try! Such an amazing country if you love your coffee strong and diverse!  One of the easiest, but very tasty and strong coffee to prepare is a Vietnamese drip coffee. When you walk around the city, you can see people sitting on their tiny chairs and sipping their coffee. Almost every home has the equipment for making a tasty drip coffee.  When I tried it the first time, I immediately got hooked and now I\'m the part of their coffee culture - drinking a few strong coffees per day, no matter the time.  No matter where you\'re in the world, you should get ingredients and equipment, so you could be always ready for one shot of Vietnamese coffee! Also, it\'s easy to get your hands on the filter and it\'s highly portable as dimensions are very small. It makes a coffee filter and coffee the portable and delicious <strong><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/souvenirs-from-vietnam\">Vietnamese souvenir</a></strong> you should bring home. <h2><strong>Vietnamese Coffee Culture Is So Strong!</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1131\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.vietnamese-coffee-culutre.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnamese drip coffee culture\" width=\"1024\" height=\"668\" />  You may ask why Vietnamese people have such a strong culture and variety when it comes to coffee.  Well, if we look a bit in the history, it\'s not a strange thing why <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-coffee-culture\">Vietnamese culture is revolving around the coffee</a>. The country is the second producer of coffee in the world!  As the country was a French colony, it was brought to Vietnam <a href=\"https://vina.com/cafe/\">during the 19th century</a> and since then, the government focuses so much effort on producing more and more.  Right now, Vietnam is producing a whopping <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25811724\">2 million tons annually</a> and the number is growing with each year.  Vietnamese people usually lead a laid-back lifestyle which means many coffee breaks. It\'s not a coincidence to see them on the street or coffee shops enjoying their coffee, no matter of the time.  <strong>Expand your knowledge: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam\">Learn about Vietnamese culture!</a></strong>  It was a really funny experience when I saw many small chairs set up on the street with Vietnamese people sitting on them while enjoying their coffee. And yeah, it was night time already.  They have so many different options when it comes to coffee and it\'s really hard to choose. I rarely drank bad coffee there.  I tried a regular drip coffee (iced and hot), coffee with condensed milk (their regular one), coconut coffee, yogurt coffee and strongest black coffee I\'ve ever had.  <strong>Each one of these blew me away, but still, I really stick to drip coffee for various reasons:</strong> <ul>   <li>our host family has the equipment at home, so it\'s easy and convenient to brew it.</li>   <li>the whole process takes around <strong>10 minutes</strong> (they really love to take your time on every action they do).</li>   <li>it\'s tasty, strong and keeps you alert and awake!</li> </ul> <h2><strong>How to Brew Vietnamese Drip Coffee At Home?</strong></h2> Maybe it sounds complicated as there is a whole process behind it, but believe me, once you get used to it, it just becomes a nice routine!  So, I will share with you the process of making a Vietnamese black coffee with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_milk\">condensed milk</a>. You could add ice or leave it black.  Anyway, if you\'re a coffee addict, you will definitely fall in love with this coffee and the whole process of preparation.  <em>Let\'s start!</em> <h3>1. Pick the right coffee beans and brand of coffee</h3> I\'m not sure about the coffee around the world, but in Vietnam, I\'m using <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Trung-Nguyen-Vietnamese-coffee-can/dp/B000F17AKC/?tag=calisequipzon-20\">Trung Nguyen coffee</a>. Many people tell amazing things about this coffee and I think it\'s not a coincidence that you can find a bag of these beans in every household.  If you\'re not in Vietnam, then my advice is to try to get that coffee brand online. <em>Don\'t worry if you can\'t get it as there are many alternatives:</em> <ul>   <li>use any dark roast coffee</li>   <li>medium coarse ground coffee will do just fine</li>   <li>any Robusta brand will make the work</li> </ul> <h3><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1132\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6278-e1541324921612.jpg\" alt=\"Trung Nguyen coffee brand in Vietnam\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" /></h3> <h3>2. Make sure that you have the equipment (Phins)</h3> Once you get your hands on the perfect coffee, it\'s time to find the right equipment that will help you in brewing the ideal coffee.  In Vietnam, it\'s called a <em>Phin</em> and it refers to a small metal cup, filter and lid. You put these three on the top of the cup and simply wait. You can literally see each drip dropping down in your cup while enjoying your time.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1133\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6050.jpg\" alt=\"Coffee phin and other equipment for Vietnamese coffee\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />  It\'s very easy to get Vietnamese coffee filter and I recommend you to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Vietnamese-Coffee-Filter-Gravity-Insert/dp/B01AK11S7C/?tag=calisequipzon-20\">check this one</a>! <h3><strong>3. Preparation process</strong></h3> Once you have a coffee, Phin and filter, you\'re ready to brew your first Vietnamese coffee at home!  It will take around 10 minutes, but don\'t worry, Vietnamese love to do everything slowly. Just enjoy and relax a bit, it\'s good for your health!  <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1134\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6054.jpg\" alt=\"Phin filled with delicious coffee\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />  First, fill the Phin with a desired amount of coffee. I usually put around 4 small spoons, but you can do even more. Vietnamese people usually fill more than half of the Phin! <p id=\"PJxWxmg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-752 aligncenter\" src=\"http://balkandigitalnomads.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ac72de50e132.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p> Put the Phin at the top of the glass/cup.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1135\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6060.jpg\" alt=\"Put the filter in the phin.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />  Once you put a desired amount of coffee inside a Phin, just put the filter on top.  <em><strong>You\'re ready for the showtime now!</strong></em>  <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1136\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6062-1.jpg\" alt=\"Process of making Vietnamese traditional coffee\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />  Fill the Phin with boiled water, sit back and relax while every drop of tasty coffee is dropping down to your cup. It will take some time, but it\'s enjoyable, especially when you\'re surrounded by nice people! <p id=\"wiNcCuL\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-755 aligncenter\" src=\"http://balkandigitalnomads.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ac72edb26328.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p> Once all the water is gone, simply press the filter to get the last drips into your cup and you\'re almost ready! <h3><strong>4. Iced, hot or coffee with condensed milk?</strong></h3> Now, it\'s time to choose the way you\'d like to drink your coffee.  You can easily add ice or leave it just as it is. I usually put some condensed milk (it\'s very sweet!) and sometimes ice when it\'s hot outside.  I found out that my favorite is iced coffee with condensed milk!  Try out different coffees to find out your favorite!  <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1137\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6069.jpg\" alt=\"Enjoy your milk coffee!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />  Enjoy your coffee! <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>What\'s your favorite coffee you tried in Vietnam?</em></strong></h3>', 'A Guide to Vietnamese Drip Coffee', 'TODO: Write Excerpt\r\n', 'draft', 'open', 'open', '', '', '', '', '2018-04-06 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', 0, 'http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/?p=12699', 0, 'post', '', 0);

In that short period, I\'ve learned so much about teaching and actually started to really enjoy in doing it.  Also, I believe I\'m so fortunate as I\'m in a very remote area where you can\'t see any other foreigner, so I have a chance to really observe and experience authentic Vietnam.  Not to forget that other volunteers, my homestay family, and people here are simply amazing!  Even when you feel low, you simply can\'t react positively to their beautiful smiles that will make you feel happy!  Starlight, a volunteering project in Quynh Luu, provided me with so much support, so I just felt to give something back to these amazing people and write an honest piece about my experience there. <h2>How at the First Place I Went to Vietnam to Volunteer?</h2> <img class=\"size-large wp-image-1053 aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6048.jpg\" alt=\"Lovely kids in the countryside.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />  I\'m sorry, but really need to share this story as I want to tell you that <strong>YOU CAN DO IT TOO!</strong>  Many people reached me and told me <em>\"Oh I wish I could travel </em>like<em> you and have the best time of my lifetime.\". </em>  <em>Well, what if I tell you that you can do it? Would you believe me?</em>  I\'m just a regular guy who realized the money and chasing career isn\'t everything in the world. I realized the experience is important as you don\'t want to end up in a system before discovering the world and yourself.  I developed a strong sense of myself during my travels and started to hate college and situations where someone tells me what to do and think.  That isn\'t freedom at all and I just wanted to think with my own head.  At the moment of dropping out of college, I was so confident that I could make it in the world no matter what. So I did exactly that!  Dropped out and focus all my energy and time on learning and experiencing new things.  After the New Year, I started to feel very lost as I moved to my hometown and didn\'t feel like growing at all.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-1054 aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.36331417_883723108494095_3435324016838049792_o.jpg\" alt=\"Outdoor class is a lot of fun!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" />  One day I started to check <strong><a href=\"https://www.asabbatical.com/article/helpstay-reviews\">HelpStay volunteering platform</a></strong> and found out an interesting project about teaching English in Vietnam. I checked the details and outreached the head of the organization.  The next day I remember checking my email totally forgetting about the outreach and I saw some new email. It was from the head of <strong><a href=\"http://c4c.vn\">Coins4Change</a></strong>.  I was so thrilled!  We agreed on a time of the interview, did two interviews and the next thing I know was buying a one-way ticket and flying to Vietnam!  I don\'t think much when it comes to adventure and I\'m always up to even craziest things.  Here I am, sitting in a very good coffee place, drinking <strong><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide\">Vietnamese traditional black coffee</a></strong> and writing this post.  Life is very good and I\'m very grateful for each moment here.  In the next section, you can find out all the information about Starlight English Center and how does it look to volunteer here as an English teacher. <h2><strong>What is Starlight and How Does It Look Like to Teach English There?</strong></h2> <p id=\"RByIIzy\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-828 aligncenter\" src=\"http://balkandigitalnomads.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ad485850fa06.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p> Starlight is one of the projects of head organization Coins4Change. It\'s an English center that focuses on improving the English knowledge of kids that live in a rural place.  <em>The rural and city kids (and adults) experience a huge gap in English knowledge, which limits them in many aspects:</em> <ul>   <li>finding the office job</li>   <li>lower payment</li>   <li>cultural exchange</li> </ul> Quynh Luu is located in Nghe An province in north-central Vietnam and Starlight English center is where we\'re teaching <strong>around 100 kids</strong> the basics (and advanced things depending on their level of knowledge) of English language.  The center has two main classrooms equipped with whiteboards, laptops, books, tables, and chairs. It\'s simple, but actually, everything that\'s needed for effective teaching. <h3>How Does a Teaching Class Look Like?</h3> <img class=\"size-large wp-image-1055 aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20180326_204832.jpg\" alt=\"One of the classes in Starlight\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />  Well, first of all, I want to tell you that I came here <strong>without any prior teaching experience</strong>. So, don\'t worry if you\'ve never done something similar as it\'s perfectly normal doing something for the first time and people here are very open and patient and they will teach you everything.  Basically, you will teach <strong>a maximum of two classes per day</strong> (one class is 1 and a half hour long) which means you will have a lot of time for yourself.  The classes start at 5:30 pm during the weekdays and it becomes a bit busier on the weekends as there is a class at 8:30 am and 3:30 pm.  For each class, you\'ll have to prepare a lesson with the support of friendly assistants and when you get used to teaching, the<strong> preparation usually takes 30 minutes</strong>.  On Tuesday, volunteers have day-off as the center is closed and you\'re free to explore the place or even travel to other cities/places. It\'s up to you and even you can travel for longer periods, but be sure to communicate that with other volunteers.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-1056 aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.dodo3.jpg\" alt=\"The craziest class ever!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />  <em>Starlight has a few groups:</em> <ul>   <li>Little Dodo - kids from 4 - 7 years old</li>   <li>Sao La - kids from 8 - 11 years old</li>   <li>Amur - 12 - 17 years old and advanced in English</li> </ul> Basically, it\'s up to you to lead the class and teach kids on the way you think it\'s effective.  <em>My class with Little Dodo looks like:</em> <ul>   <li>In the beginning, we\'re having fun with each other introducing each other</li>   <li>Playing songs and dance around the classroom</li>   <li>Review the last topic</li>   <li>Introduce new words</li>   <li>Play games with the star system (kids here are very competitive and it will make them focused)</li>   <li>Play some more songs</li>   <li>Working on some tasks that check their knowledge from the lesson we covered</li> </ul> <img class=\"size-large wp-image-1057 aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6349.jpg\" alt=\"Sometimes, kids become too crazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />  <em>Crucial tips when teaching kids English:</em> <ul>   <li>Be very patient as kids usually tend to lose focus or interest.</li>   <li>Be creative and try to always make them think out of the box.</li>   <li>Play, dance and make them having fun, but at the same time educate them.</li>   <li>Don\'t teach them by making them memorize. Try to experience them things as that\'s the best way to teach.</li>   <li>Be energetic and positive all the time.</li>   <li>Encourage them and when you see a kid has struggle with self-confidence you should work on it too.</li>   <li>I don\'t see myself only as an English teacher but also trying to teach them basic skills and raise their self-confidence as I believe it\'s the crucial thing in life.</li>   <li>There will be ups and downs, so better prepare for that.</li> </ul> <h2><strong>Homestay and How Does a Regular Day Looks Like</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1058\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6292.jpg\" alt=\"Courtyard in the homestay\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />  While volunteering with Starlight, you\'ll be accommodated in a homestay near the center living with one of the most hospital and warm Vietnamese family.

Also, I don\'t want to forget to include Dodo, a crazy, but a loving dog that shares the home with us and of course lunch and dinner (sorry Dodo for such small portions as the food is so amazing and there are literally no leftovers). :)  <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1059\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6280.jpg\" alt=\"Lunch with a host family\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />  Their home is very convenient as volunteers will have their <strong>own room with privacy</strong>. You have all the important things like a desk, bed, closet, and fan.  There is a kitchen where we eat with the family. You will get a lunch (around 11 am), dinner (around 9 pm) and sometimes breakfast.  <em>Why did I tell sometimes? </em>  Well, if you wake up around 6 am, then you\'ll be lucky to have breakfast. Vietnamese aren\'t so keen on breakfast but really respect their lunch and dinner time.  The food is amazingly delicious and fresh. Every day there is something new on the table, but the base is rice in a small bowl and of course a soy sauce.  <em><strong>Thank you Hang for treating us so well with the meals!</strong></em>  In the middle of the homestay, there is a vast courtyard with benches, so that\'s a usual place for sitting, drinking coffee and speaking with other volunteers.  And yeah, you have a coffee and tea in unlimited quantities. ;)  There is one toilet and shower as well as outdoors sink and laundry for volunteers. You don\'t need to worry about it as you can do it at home.  I almost forgot, there are <strong>two motorbikes, bicycle and electric bike for use.</strong>  <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1066\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.homestay.jpg\" alt=\"Lunchtime with other volunteers\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />  I tend to always ask Hang or Thach for the permission of using these as they\'re also using them.  It\'s just an amazing way of transportation around Quynh Luu, especially on day-offs as you don\'t need to worry about renting motorbikes. <h2><strong>Things to Do in Quynh Luu</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1065\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6299.jpg\" alt=\"Chilling atmosphere in the town.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />  As I already mentioned, the city is located in a rural place in central Vietnam and knowing that there are not so many things to do.  Depending on your goals and mindset, it could be a game maker or breaker.  I really love it here as I love a bit laid back life without tourists around and Quynh Luu seems like a perfect combination of both.  <strong>Learn more: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam\">Vietnamese culture can shock you in many ways!</a></strong>  It\'s perfect for people who want to focus on building their business because there are no distractions and you will have so much free time.  Also, I noticed that I don\'t waste my time and I started to be very aware of my time so the majority of the time I\'m working on the projects, exploring the landscape, going to the gym, driving with the motorbike, eating new food, drinking amazing coffee and having fun with Vietnamese people.  Did you know I\'ve got a motorbike as a gift in Vietnam from a woman I\'ve never talked or seen before?

I really started to like teaching and I\'m thinking of getting my <strong>TEFL certificate</strong> so I could teach around Asia.  Even if you don\'t have any experience you can come to teach here. People are very patient and helpful, so they will help you with everything.  After two weeks you will become very good and natural in teaching (my experience).  Wish to thank my hosting family for making me feel like I\'m at home and Starlight for an amazing opportunity.  <img class=\"wp-image-1063 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6294.jpg\" alt=\"The loyal friend in the house\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Our Do-Do.

(12701, 3, '2018-05-25 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'Vietnam is a vibrant country with such diverse landscape and a deep sense of the culture and traditions. I was aware of that before arriving here, but there is one thing I wasn\'t aware of - Vietnam is also a country full of pleasant surprises.  Before arriving here, I knew that I want to get a motorbike, so I could be able to travel across the country at my own pace and experience an ultimate freedom.  The motorbikes here are very cheap, but you know, you get what you paid for. That line can\'t better describe motorbikes in Vietnam.  The most common bike for doing a road trip through this amazing country is, of course, Honda (replica of Honda) Win. These bikes are usually used by backpacker and adventurers to drive from North to South or another way around.  No matter which bike you get, you should be aware of the fact these bikes were probably driven tens of times through the country. It means the breakdowns are inevitable and it\'s just the question when you\'ll experience a breakdown (Knock knock, as I haven\'t experienced any till now!).  Vietnam is one of these Asian countries where the traffic is just crazy! In Europe, the buses and trucks are usually the slowest means of transportation, but not in Vietnam!  Here these guys are the fastest on the road. Sometimes it feels like they are playing Need for Speed in a real life with horning on anything that\'s moving on the road!  Anyway, this didn\'t stop me from getting the bike here.  <em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>I don\'t advise inexperienced drivers to learn how to drive a motorbike in Vietnam as the conditions on the road and traffic are very unpredictable. I had the experience to drive a motorbike in Thailand, so I learned how to drive and be comfortable in Asian traffic. </em>  Knowing myself, these facts were more than enough for me to decide to get the motorbike in Vietnam. <h2><strong>Daydreaming About the Motorbike</strong></h2> In Vietnam, I\'m a volunteer, which means I don\'t earn any money for teaching and I need to figure out how to earn money here. I\'m a type of hustler, so getting money was never a problem for me.  There is a huge group called <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/882003845187734/\">Vietnam Backpackers</a> </strong>where people usually post their bikes for sale. The average price for a decent Honda Win is around <strong>$250</strong> and it was still far away.  I was daydreaming almost every day and aimlessly scrolling down the page to see which bike will I, fortunately, get in the near future.  I remember one day was a bit different and kind of special for me!  It was Sunday, around the lunchtime, and it was hot as hell! (You may think it\'s just a regular day for Vietnam, but wait!)  I\'ve got used to Vietnamese lifestyle, which means I\'ve become a bit lazy, so after the lunchtime, I usually enjoy Siesta time (lying down, <strong><a href=\"http://balkandigitalnomads.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide/\">drinking tasty coffee</a></strong> and practicing the art of doing nothing.).  It was my time of daydreaming, so as I usually did, I opened the group and started to scroll down.  There were nothing new, just awesome bikes with the distant price for me, but I was really enjoying the thoughts of being able to get one of these one day.  <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1160 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.gift.jpg\" alt=\"Post on the facebook group\" width=\"617\" height=\"501\" />  I was re-reading the post a few times as it sounds like a slap in my face.  I just sent the message to Julia and we were talking. She is a pretty positive and open-minded woman who is also an English teacher in Vietnam.  I said that I would really love this bike as it was my dream, and she said: <em><strong>\"It\'s yours!\".</strong></em>  I was puzzled! Literally puzzled!  <strong>(Still, don\'t know how to thank you for your kind action!)</strong> <h3><strong>There was a catch of course...</strong></h3> It\'s hard to believe everything is perfect or ideal, so there is always a catch.  The catch was that she left Hanoi and she gave the bike to her friend. I immediately sent the message to her friend and we\'ve got in the talk.  He was leaving Hanoi the same day and he sent me the message that he would leave the bike in certain location!  I\'ve got the pin on the map and the picture where were keys and documentation hidden.  <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1162 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.31484454_10104912527233011_3339961470690525184_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" />  The message I\'ve got: <strong><em>\"The keys and documentation are hidden below the bricks.\"</em></strong>  If you\'ve ever been to Hanoi, then you probably know it\'s a city with the population that is almost three times bigger than the population in the whole of Croatia. The traffic is crazy, the streets are narrow and it\'s easy to get lost.  So, I was on the quest to find these bricks in the middle of Hanoi!  I haven\'t thought a second and just accepted the challenge! <h2><strong>1000 Battles in Hanoi</strong></h2> So, I\'ve just hopped to the bus and the ride was supposed to be around 4 hours, but it lasted for almost 6 hours!  I haven\'t prepared myself for anything, so when I arrived in Hanoi, I was greeted by a huge rain! The only piece of clothing I had was tanks and t-shirt. Very smart of me!  I arrived at the night time, but I was determined to try to locate the bike, so I went to the location that I\'ve got from Julia\'s friend.  <em><strong>There was a huge catch!</strong></em>  <strong>Expand your knowledge: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam\">Learn about Vietnamese culture and differences!</a></strong>  I didn\'t know that the bike is somewhere in alleys of Hanoi. It was a huge part of Hanoi with narrow alleys and local shops around.  If you\'ve ever found yourself in that situation, then it\'s the most certain you will get lost many times until you reach your destination, even if you have a GPS.  The thing was that my destination was to find few bricks of mortar and the bike!  Of course, I\'ve got the approximate location and not the certain one! Because why to make things easier as it can be more interesting, especially when you\'re walking around the chaotic streets of Hanoi.  <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1163 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.poor-baby.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />  I met one local man who tried to help me about the location (he was living around the place) and after an hour of searching, he wasn\'t able to help me! Imagine the struggle and I was so sorry for the guy as he was feeling so bad because he couldn\'t help me.  <strong><em>(I\'m sorry that I\'ve </em>forgotten<em> your name man, but if you\'ll ever read this piece, thank you so much for amazing help and </em>advice<em>!)</em></strong>  It was around 9 pm already and I knew it was my last call to eat something as Vietnamese usually close everything after 9 pm.  I went to a Pho place and ate one of the best Phos in Vietnam. Although, I haven\'t opened my senses fully as I was consumed with the thoughts that I\'ve got scammed or that I will never able to find the bike.  Anyway, after a delicious dinner, I said myself it would be the last try!  I did a detailed walk around the alleys one more time and in the corner of my eyes, I spotted the bike!  I can\'t describe how happy I was at that moment!  Seconds later I\'ve found the bricks and keys and documentation secretly stashed there! Just wooow!  The catch was the motorbike was a bit broken (lights, and the front tire), so I wasn\'t so eager to drive it through Hanoi without the lights.  I took the Grab to the volunteer house to regain my energy and think of the next steps as I needed to get back to Quynh Luu next day! <h2>Challenges of Getting Bike in Function</h2> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1164 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.mechanics.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" />  I\'ve got some pleasant dreams and got disrupted by a noisy alarm clock that I\'ve set at 6 am. I was lying down on the bed and snoozing for an hour until I\'ve got enough energy to leave my cozy bed.  I went to the best Pho place to eat that soup since I was in Hanoi (thanks Bryan for showing me that place!).  After that, I headed to the place of crime to check the bike.  I couldn\'t move it as the front tire was stuck and the time was ticking.  I went to the nearest coffee place to think about my options and what should I do.  <strong><em>There were a few possible options:</em></strong> <ul>   <li>get the bike somehow to the bus station, put it into the bus and leave Hanoi with the bike. The only catch was that I needed some ride that will get me and the bike to the bus station that was 2 km away</li>   <li>go to the mechanic to repair it</li>   <li>just leave the bike</li> </ul> Luckily, like the universe was on my side, there was a local guy beside me, enjoying the morning coffee. I asked him if he knows any English (such a rude question in Hanoi, but I\'m so used to a rural life where no one speaks English).  I explained him my situation and surprisingly, he was so eager to help me as his words were: <em><strong>\"You\'re a stranger in my land and I want to help the strangers as when I go to your land I believe in the help from locals there. You get what you get.\"</strong></em>  We drove to the motorbike and he called a mechanic and they pulled the bike away to their shop.  <strong>Motorbike guide: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam\">Buying a reliable motorbike in Vietnam!</a></strong>  The bike was repaired and while we were waiting, we were smoking and drinking a strong tea in the alleys of Hanoi. This guy was so open-minded and positive and I\'ve made a new friend.  The mechanics made the bike functional, but it wasn\'t fully repaired yet.  They said that it will bring me to Quynh Luu with some luck.  I did a test ride around and I was sucking so much as Hanoi is crazy with the traffic. <h2><strong>Getting Outside Hanoi Was a Huge Struggle</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1165 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.baby-on-hte-road.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" />  Alright, so the bike was in a half-functional mode and I decided I will drive the bike back home.  I was following the guy and he gave me the instructions on how to get outside the city, but he saw that I was completely lost (scared of the traffic and the weather was sooo hot!)  He was so good that, even after spending half of his daytime with me, he showed me how to get on the right road and get outside the city.  <strong>(So thankful that I met you, Tuan! We will meet again!)</strong>  The distance between Hanoi and Quynh Luu is about 250 km, so as being optimistic, I calculated I will make it in 4 hours like a bus. <h3><strong>Oh boy, how wrong I was!</strong></h3> I started a trip at 12 pm and arrived at my hometown at 9 pm - <em><strong>9 hours of ride on a half-functional bike.</strong></em>  I wasn\'t aware of the fact that, at that time, the bike was not in a full function and whenever I went faster than <strong>50 km/h</strong>, it got very unstable and dangerous.  <img class=\"wp-image-1166 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.ontheway.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A quick stop on the way to Cau Giat in Nghe An.</div>  So, I was driving for 9 hours on a highway on the hottest day I could imagine.  I was driving by day, I was driving by night without proper lights, I was driving while being chased by crazy thunderstorm behind me. I\'ve got me and motorbike home and I am alive! <h2><strong>Wait, it\'s not the end of lucky circumstances </strong></h2> Next day, I\'ve sent the message to Julia with the picture of the motorbike and I asked here where are you now.  She sent me the message that they were heading Vinh (the city that is around 60 km away from my hometown).  I couldn\'t believe and shared with her my location, and she said they were passing that town! We set the meeting in my hometown! What a coincidence, right?  <strong>Budgeting skills: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget\">How much money do you need for a whole motorbike trip around the country?</a></strong>  We had an amazing talk and time and I met her and two other crazy guys, Tom and Joel.  I showed them my home and they met Bryan and Lou, they crazy guys I\'m living with!  <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1167 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.crazyy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />  We made a deal that we\'re going to meet in Vinh to spend a day on the beach together the next day!  The next thing I remember was being totally wasted and playing frisbee with amazing people on the stunning beach near Vinh, Cao Lo.  The next day, we separated our ways as they were heading to the south and we needed to get back to our hometown.  <hr />  The bike was named \"Daisy the Nightrider\", but I simply needed to rename it to PEGLICA!  <em><strong>By now, I invested 800k VND and it\'s one of the fastest and loudest bikes around! </strong></em>  <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9vBFO_2ZeQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z8-B-b-2Cr8\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  Here are some pictures from PEGLICA around Vietnam! ;)  <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1168 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.34011293_985092245000340_4124327893142601728_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1169 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.chilling.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1170 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.chilling2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1171 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_0301.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1172 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_1014.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1173 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_2267.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1174 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20180605_152418.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1175 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20180821_113837.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1176 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Phong-Nha-21.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1177 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Phong-Nha-26.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />  Can\'t say in the words how thankful I am for everything!

Great! Don\'t miss the stunning coastal city of Da Nang. The city is literally located on the coast in central Vietnam and has a lot to offer. You will have a great city vibe, but also, when you feel tired of the city, you can easily go to the near mountains, breathtaking passes and even surf on the beach. The options are countless, but smoking weed in Da Nang will definitely make your experience even more interesting!  Cannabis in Da Nang is widely used and people here are more opened than in the northern part of Vietnam, especially <a href=\"https://weeducation.co/weed-in-hanoi/\">Hanoi</a>.  If that sounds good to you and you\'d like to learn more about the plant in Da Nang, keep reading as we\'re going provide you with the information on getting and smoking weed in Da Nang. <h2><strong>Cannabis Laws </strong></h2> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-947\" src=\"https://weeducation.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cannabis-prices-in-danang.jpg\" alt=\"Cannabis laws in Da Nang\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Laws regarding cannabis are very strict on the paper, but in the practice, there is nothing that few dollars can\'t fix.</div>  On the paper, Vietnam is one of the strictest countries when it comes to cannabis. You can end up in a serious trouble if you get caught there, but there is always a way - many ways actually!  Vietnam is still struggling with their political order and they are still a communist country where the corruption is on a high level. A bribe can save you so much hustle in Vietnam and police officers will almost always ask for a \'compensation\' in order to leave you alone.  Da Nang is a very open and modern city with not so much crime, so police isn\'t so much focused on cannabis. They are more focused on civil problems and traffic. We read some stories from foreigners who got caught in Da Nang with cannabis and all of them were smoking while get caught. The police will try to scare you at first which is totally logical as you\'re doing a very big offense in this country by the laws, but then, they usually settle with the bribe of around $50 - $100.  Sometimes, they do the random raids of the pubs and clubs that are known for selling cannabis, so they can give you a drug test and you can end up in the station for a night if you\'re positive.  Anyway, Da Nang is the very awesome city to smoke as it has many perfect spots with stunning views to chill. However, be careful and don\'t smoke in the public as it can be a hustle to get rid of police, especially if you\'re not talking the same language. <h2><strong>Where to Get Weed in Da Nang</strong></h2> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-948 aligncenter\" src=\"https://weeducation.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/where-to-get-weed-in-danang.jpg\" alt=\"Best places to get cannabis in Da Nang\" width=\"1280\" height=\"791\" />  Getting cannabis is relatively easy in Da Nang. Also, it\'s one of the cities where you\'ll have the chance to choose between a few different strains of weed which you won\'t see in many places in Vietnam. Usually, you can get your hands on Australian or Canadian imported kush (high-quality buds), Cambodian import (mid-quality) and Vietnamese schwag.  We tried all three common sorts of weed and after doing some comparison we came up with an interesting conclusion. Vietnamese weed is looking so bad, but it\'s working. You will feel the buzz and a good high, but as the weed is low-quality, your eyes will feel it! :)  Cambodian weed is a bit more expensive, but it\'s a good price for the quantity and quality you get. The weed looks solid and the high is similar to Vietnamese schwag.  Next, the highest grade weed is labeled as a \'kush\' around Da Nang, but we don\'t believe it has anything with kush. It\'s overpriced and probably homegrown weed targeted for expats and foreign tourists. We tried it, and the high is very good, but the price is usually higher than the price in Europe or USA for the same quantity of so much better weed.  When it comes to buying cannabis in Da Nang, it\'s a relatively easy task. Just head over the expat area or walk around My Khe beach. There are few options around the area how to get weed. The first option is to just walk around the beach and taxi drivers will approach you and ask you if you\'d like to get some.  We advise you to skip on that as the weed is very low quality and they will always give you a smaller amount than they say. Also, there are stories and experiences of other people that these people are working with the police, so as soon they give you the bag, they will rat you over the police for a compensation in a bribe.  We tried that option too around Vietnam but never had any problem with the police. The only problem was the quality and quantity of cannabis we\'ve got. Just skip out this option as it\'s very easy to score in Da Nang.  Instead of buying on the street, just head over popular My An expat area where you can just walk around the pubs there and see what\'s going on.

The city is located near Da Nang on the beautiful Vietnamese coast and the architecture is full of French colonial buildings. You can try amazing traditional street food around the city and get some interesting souvenirs from street vendors. If you get overwhelmed by the number of people in the city, you can always go outside the city to the beautiful countryside and chill the views while smoking the joint.  Hoi An is a small city and sometimes it can be hard to score some cannabis around without getting ripped off, but there are the ways, don\'t worry.  <em><strong>Keep reading as we\'re going to provide you with all the information on getting and smoking weed in Hoi An!</strong></em> <h2><strong>Cannabis Laws in Hoi An</strong></h2> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-972 aligncenter\" src=\"https://weeducation.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cannabis-laws-1.jpg\" alt=\"Laws related to cannabis hugely differ from the paper and the practice\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" />  Every province, city and town in Vietnam has the same laws regarding drugs and cannabis. Some places are more opened to cannabis as there are many foreigner visitors who\'re putting a lot of money to the local economy, so the officials are quite tolerant to cannabis. Hoi An is one of these places, so the laws on paper are totally different than how the officials apply them in the practice.  Just walking around the city, you can sometimes smell cannabis, even in the most crowded streets around Hoi An. The place is literally filled with the tourists all around the world and there is so much money circulating around Hoi An, so police don\'t bother too much about the weed, especially if you\'re not smoking in the middle of tourist area,  On the paper, you can get up in prison for having small quantities of cannabis with you, but in the practice, it never happens, especially with foreigners. Police is used to corruption as the salaries are low, so they will settle for a bribe all the time.  In Hoi An, like at every place in Vietnam, you can buy out your way outside the trouble. Sometimes it will be expensive, but hey, you won\'t end up in Vietnamese prisons which are really notorious. Also, the police is focusing more on distribution and selling cannabis, so if you\'re caught with the intention to sell it, you will definitely end up in big trouble where the bribe won\'t be enough to get you out.  Be careful and use your common sense always! <h2><strong>Where to Get Weed in Hoi An</strong></h2> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-971 aligncenter\" src=\"https://weeducation.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/where-to-get-weed-in-hoi-an.jpg\" alt=\"where to get weed in Hoi An?\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" />  Weed in Hoi An is a very usual vice and many people are using it. The reason for it is probably as there are many tourists and beautiful natural spots around the center. Sometimes, it can be tough to get your hands on any weed worth smoking in Hoi An, but if you know the places or people, that process will be extremely easy.  We\'ve been to Hoi An and tried some weed there, so we can give you some information on getting weed there. Also, there are many alternative options, especially if you\'re flexible with your transportation.  The most common option in the town to get weed is by dealing with taxi drivers. Sometimes they will just wink at you, but sometimes they will openly ask you if you want some marijuana. It\'s the most common option to get weed in Hoi An, but the quality, quantity and security are very questionable.  If you choose that option, remember to always bargain for the price, check the looks and smell of cannabis and go to the secluded place with the driver which is preferably not next to your accommodation. The reason for these precautions is following: taxi drivers usually work with the police and if they rat you out they will share the bribe with them, sometimes they put a bit of weed and a lot of tea inside the bag.  Another option, which is better, is to check out the area around An Bang beach. There are many bars filled with expats and tourists and you will almost all the time smell some cannabis there. Just be friendly and approach people and they will definitely help you out.  There is a bar called \'Tiger Bar\' and if you go there and ask for the weed, you can expect to get your hands filled with some decent Vietnamese weed.

The prices for the locals are hugely different than prices for foreigners. Always keep that in mind when bargaining as the dealers will usually settle for a lower price than asked one.

The weed is very low-quality, so we really advise you to skip this option.  In the pubs around Hoi An, they will usually ask for 500,000 VND for a baggie of 5 grams of solid weed.

The USA and some other countries totally legalized recreational cannabis use and it\'s noticeable that it\'s driving a lot of tax money from tourism to improve the communities.  Many people started to grow their own cannabis since technology improved and the information is easily available on the internet. Today, there are so many different ways of growing your own cannabis and thousands of strains available.  Sometimes, it can be a tough task to decide which strain you should try to grow or smoke. The best way is to just experiment until you find the best suiting cannabis strain for you.  A very popular growing method in the last years is called cannabis cloning.  This method is very cheap and you get a plant with the desired characteristics.  If you\'re thinking that cloning might be something new for you in a growing career, then this guide is perfect for you!  <em>Keep reading as we\'re going to provide you with every bit of information required to grow your own cannabis clones.</em>  <hr />  <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>What is Cannabis Cloning?</strong></h2> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1022 aligncenter\" src=\"https://weeducation.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/marijuana-clone.jpg\" alt=\"marijuana clone outdoors\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" />  In the last few years, there is a lot of information on cloning cannabis, and you probably heard many things about it.  You can clone any plant in the world, and we\'re so lucky that cannabis is just a plant like any other plant that has a root system.  Basically, cloning is choosing the plant with the right and desired characteristics, taking the part of it and growing another plant with the same genetics.  <em><strong>Does it mean you will have exactly the same plant?</strong></em>  No, it doesn\'t mean that your plant will look exactly the same when it comes to size and yield, but the characteristics will be identical. You need to be very selective when it comes to picking the plant you\'d like to clone. It\'s crucial that the plant is healthy and you like the characteristics when it comes to smoking.  We already mentioned that you\'re picking a small part of the plant and growing it as a separate plant. You cut a few stems from the mother plant (a plant you\'d like to clone) and then growing the rooting system of the clone until it isn\'t ready to grow on its own.  <em>In the following headings, we\'re going to provide you with details on each step of cannabis cloning!</em>  <hr />  <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Things You Should Know About the Clones Before Starting</strong></h2> Cloning isn\'t a science, but even the most experienced growers fail with growing the clones sometimes.  <em>There are some things you should definitely know before deciding to start with cloning marijuana plants:</em>  <strong>Low costs of growing -</strong> We all know that cannabis seeds can be very expensive, so if you\'re on the budget, then having clones is the perfect thing for you. You just need a mother plant and you can cut as many clones as you want. It means you can produce as many plants as possible from just one plant. Such a huge money saving if you know what to do!  <strong>A clone is a copy of a mother plant - </strong>The clone won\'t be an exact copy of the mother plant and it won\'t grow to exact size, but it will be very close. The reason for it is that the clone starts without a root system and the root won\'t be huge as in the regular plant. Anything else, the characteristics of the buds and high will be the same. The perfect thing is that you will already know so much about the plant before cutting the clones, so you can be sure what kind of plant you can expect.  <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1021 aligncenter\" src=\"https://weeducation.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cannabis-clone.jpg\" alt=\"cannabis plant in the flowering process\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" />  <strong>A quicker start in growing - </strong>Many people choose growing clones as they want to have buds faster. For instance, the clones will faster reach the size and development of the mother plant than the newly grown plants from the seed. If you don\'t have much time, then it\'s a perfect way as it can yield you some potent buds in a shorter period than usual.  <strong>You can cut the clones almost anytime - </strong>The great time with the clones is that you can cut them from the mother plant on almost any phase of the growth. Of course, you can\'t cut it when the plant is still in an early vegetative state, but after 4 weeks of growth, the plant is ready to yield some clones. Also, if you cut the clones from the bottom, the plant will create a root faster. The same goes for cutting from the top which will give you better results in the flowering phase.  <strong>Challenges in growing - </strong>Clones are not for everyone! You need to have a certain equipment and knowledge before growing clones. Also, if you think that you found your perfect strain, then just go for cloning! :)  <em>These are few important things you should have in mind before starting with growing cannabis clones. Now, we will share with you details that will help you in actually growing your own clones! </em>  <hr />  <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Equipment You\'ll Need for Cloning</strong></h2> Basically, you don\'t need any equipment except the mother plant, scissors, and soil where you\'ll put your clones. You can improvise everything, but with improvisation comes the risk.  The equipment for cloning isn\'t expensive and you probably have all of that already at your home, so don\'t worry!  <strong>A healthy mother plant with proper genes - </strong>The mother plant is the prerequisite for growing your cannabis clones. Be sure the plant is perfectly healthy and that the gender is female. If you don\'t have a mother plant, you can find <a href=\"https://askmeaboutmarijuana.com/\">clones for sale</a> online and pick the right plant from a huge selection.  <strong>Sharp scissors - </strong>This is the equipment that can be found in almost every household. If you don\'t have it already, you should get one even if you don\'t think about cloning. These are used for trimming and are suitable for doing a perfect cut. Believe us, you don\'t want to mess your mother plant and clones because you don\'t have proper scissors!  <strong>Suitable starter cubes - </strong>It\'s important to have small cubes where you\'ll put your newly cut clones. The cubes will give enough space for the clones to create a healthy root system.  <strong>Root complex - </strong>It\'s not a required to have any root complex, but it will hugely help in creating the root system of your newly clones. In the beginning, the clones start without the root and they are very prone to illness. It\'s crucial to grow the root as soon as possible, so picking a root complex in a form of a gel or powder can be a smart investment.  <strong>A proper light system - </strong>You don\'t need a light if you\'re planning to grow clones outdoors. It\'s possible to do it, but it\'s very hard since outdoors\' conditions can be very rough for small plants without the root. We advise you to get CFL 150W and this light will do the job at the beginning stages of the clone growth.  <hr />  <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>How to Cut a Clone From a Mother Plant?</strong></h2> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1026 aligncenter\" src=\"https://weeducation.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mother-cannabis-plant.jpg\" alt=\"Mother cannabis plant\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" />  Now when you have a basic idea what a cannabis cloning is and which equipment you need to have before starting the process, you\'re ready to start cutting the clones. In this part, we\'re going to provide you with the information on how to properly cut the clones from a mother plant.  First of all, before doing any cutting or modifying on any cannabis plant, you need to make sure that your cutting equipment is clean and disinfected. The small splash of water and dip in an ethyl alcohol will do the work.  If you\'re taking the clones from a mature plant, be sure that the plant is actually mature as you will just hurt the plant otherwise. Once you have many stems and leaves (usually after three weeks of vegetation), your plant is ready for taking clones.  <em>Here are the steps you should follow in order to get clones ready for putting in the soil:</em> <ul>          <li>Be sure that a mother plant is ready for cutting clones. Once you\'re sure, then you can prepare your starter cubes. Just put a bit of water a few minutes before putting the clones inside.</li>          <li>Once you\'re sure everything is ready, you\'re ready for the cutting. You should pick up the top of the plant from the new branch. Always cut in a 45-degree angle and don\'t take the clone that is longer than 20 cm. The reason for that is that the mother plant is going through a huge pressure and stress during cutting.</li>          <li>Always cut from the lower stems as these have a higher concentration of root hormones. Also, if you want the flowering process to be faster and yielding, then just cut the higher stems. Both will work well as you will need to nurture clones with many nutrients at the beginning.</li>          <li>When you cut the clone, it\'s time to put it in a water. You should do it immediately as the bubbles of air will start to collect in a cutting place and you want to prevent it as it will just hurt the root forming process.</li>          <li>Just leave the clones to sit for few minutes in the water until you\'re preparing a root gel or powder. Dip down your clones in the powder or gel (preferably both) and move them to started cubes.</li> </ul> <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xFw3FObhuwQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  Basically, that\'s it! It doesn\'t seem like a complicated process, right?  Just follow these steps and you will most likely be successful in making your own cannabis clones.  <hr />  <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Nurturing Your Newly Cut Clones</strong></h2> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1027 aligncenter\" src=\"https://weeducation.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/new-cannabis-clones.jpg\" alt=\"Nurturing newly cut cannabis clones\" width=\"1280\" height=\"851\" />  Once you successfully cut your clones and you put them inside started cubes, it\'s time to nurture them with enough nutrients, light, and humidity.  Since the clones don\'t have a root at the beginning, the plant needs to get the water and all the nutrients through the leaves. It means you need to spray the plants a few times per day with a water or keep the clones in a highly humid and warm environment.  If you\'re growing indoors, it can be easily done, but with outdoors just be sure that you\'re spraying with the water a few times per day and checking the condition of the plants often.  The perfect temperature for nurturing clones is around 24C which is not that hard to maintain indoors.  When it comes to lightning, many growers advise to use up to 150W CFL lamp since you don\'t need much energy for the new plants. The best light/dark setting would be 18/6 as the rooting system grows the best when there is a small amount of darkness involved.  For outdoor growers, just be sure that you\'re growing the clones in the right period of the year with the long days and short nights.  <hr />  <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>8 Crucial Tips to Grow Your Cannabis Clones Successfully</strong></h2> Many people started with growing their plants from the clones since this method has many benefits. The only problem is that people usually fail to bring their clones from the beginning stage to the flowering stage.  <em>If you\'re following our guide, then you shouldn\'t have any problem, but still, there are 8 crucial steps you need to be aware of all the time when growing cannabis plant from the clones:</em> <h3><strong>1) Pick the Healthy Mother Plant</strong></h3> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1029 aligncenter\" src=\"https://weeducation.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/healthy-mother-plant.jpg\" alt=\"Healthy mother plant\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" />  The biggest reason most growers fail in growing their marijuana plants from the clones is the bad genetics of the mother plant. It\'s the most crucial step to pick the right cannabis plant which you will clone.  We already talked about the importance of genetics and that the clone will have totally identically genetics and characteristics as a mother plant, so why not to put enough time to decide and pick the right plant?  We advise to always wait till an early flowering stage as you will be able to tell the gender of the plant. You want to take the clones from a female plant only!  Also, if you\'re waiting till the early flowering stage, the plant will be very resistant to stress and you will be able to tell about the health and condition of it. <h3><strong>2) Humidity Is the Key!</strong></h3> Remember that newly cut clones don\'t have a root system! You can\'t nurture them through the soil, so it\'s important to always keep the humidity high. You should always check your plants if they are wet! Spraying them with the water a few times per day will do the work!  Just avoid spraying the plant in the middle of the day if you\'re growing outdoors since the sun can definitely burn the clones that are very prone to any kind of sickness.  Also, to keep the humidity levels high, you can use plastic bags and cover the clones with it. That will keep the humidity high all the time, so you don\'t need to worry all the time about spraying the clones. <h3><strong>3) Provide Your Clones With Enough Nutrients</strong></h3> <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xw83XVRVdTw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  When you starting out with the cannabis clones, the plants won\'t have a root system which means you need to provide many nutrients to enhance the root development.  The best nutrients you can use to grow healthy root systems are B-1 and potassium. Also, don\'t forget to use root complex powders or gels that will boost the growth of your clones.  You can also use the regular flowering nutrients at the beginning that have high concentrations of phosphorus.  Just remember to always use 1/2 or 1/4 of the amount you would usually use for the plants you\'re growing from the seed. <h3><strong>4) Cut the Clones From the Bottom Parts of the Mother Plant</strong></h3> <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MNtEaKslYes\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  Always be sure that you\'re cutting from the bottom of the healthy plant for the fastest development of the root system. The reason for that is a high concentration of root growth hormones that can be found in the stems that are located on the bottom of the plant.  When you have a healthy mother plant, you don\'t need to worry much as you can literally cut any part of it. If you decide to cut from the upper part of the plant, it\'s also fine since the flowering process will be much faster.  If you\'re not using any equipment and root complex nutrients, then just cut the bottom part as it will be a challenge to grow the root and healthy clone without any nutrients for root growth. <h3><strong>5) Prepare a Mother Plant for the Cloning Process</strong></h3> Cutting the parts of the plant is a huge stress for any plant in any stage of development, so it\'s crucial to prepare the plant for the stress.  The best way is to grow the plant until you can see the gender. Start with the flowering nutrients few weeks before cutting the plant. You should use less nitrogen for few weeks before cutting and add more phosphorus as it will give your clones a head start in growing a root system. <h3><strong>6) Always Cut More Then You Need</strong></h3> That is a general rule in growing cannabis, especially growing clones. Always take more than expected as there is a huge possibility that you will mess up something or clones simply won\'t perform as expected.  If you have more clones than expected, you can throw stagnant plants and just focus on clones that are performing well!  <hr />  So, now you know how to do cannabis cloning right way! Just follow the tips and advice we provided you in this guide and you\'ll be fine!

We excluded the visa costs and flight costs.  <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1215\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.overall-budget-graph.jpg\" alt=\"Overall trip budget per head - in graphic format!\" width=\"704\" height=\"532\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Overall trip budget per head - in graphic format!</em></div>  Based on our total costs, let’s dive in the expense categories to give you a picture on what we spent the most and least on our motorbike trip! <h2><b>Food Cost in Vietnam (~$4,95 per day)</b></h2> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1254\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20180802_190556.jpg\" alt=\"Banh Khoai\" width=\"4160\" height=\"2340\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>The delicious Banh Khoai pancakes!</em></div>  Ah, the food in Vietnam. It’s delicious, diverse, and cheap! Actually one of the cheapest in South East Asia!   <em><strong>From the traditional Pho rice noodle soup to Banh Mi baguette sandwiches to tasty seafood, there is something for every taste.</strong></em>  How cheap is the food in Vietnam though? Based on our expenses, we spent roughly </span><b>$262 or 6,105,857 Vietnamese Dong</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That was enough to fill up our bellies for three times a day.  Most of our meals were in the little restaurants that locals have. Street food is fresh, cheap and by eating it, you’re also supporting the locals!  <img class=\"wp-image-1328 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.street-food-vietnam-1.jpg\" alt=\"Street food in Vietnam is the cheapest option.\" width=\"4160\" height=\"2340\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Street food in Vietnam is the cheapest option.</em></div>  We also visited the “regular” (“westernized”, “tourist-friendly”) restaurants in Phong Nha and in Hue where food prices were much higher and tailored to tourist budget. So, if you want to eat in Vietnam on a budget, <strong>we recommend the street food</strong>.  <b><i>Note:</i></b><i> I can’t stress this enough, but when you’re eating street food, <strong>always ask for the price</strong> before you order it! Just ask “bow nyew” (“how much?”), and you can agree on the price. We forgot to do this many times and in some cases got ripped off a bit! (Not too much though, the food costs are meager!)</i>  What are the regular prices for the food though? It mostly depends on where you are.  <i>For example, in Hanoi Old Quarter, we paid 55,000 Dong ($2,36) for a bowl of Pho soup. You can get the same in the suburban part of the town for as little as 30,000 Dong ($1,29), and it will most likely be of higher quality. In highway villages, the food prices are generally lower than in cities.</i> <ul>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The traditional Pho soup will cost from <strong>30,000 - 45,000 Vietnamese Dong ($1,29 - $1,94)</strong>. </li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banh Mi is usually <strong>10,000 - 20,000 Vietnamese Dong ($0,43 - $0,86)</strong>. </li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is also the delicious Mi Xao, a rice noodle dish that you can spice up with chili sauce and soy sauce (everything rice related is so much better with soy sauce, it’s very addictive!). Expect to pay anywhere between <strong>30,000 - 50,000 Vietnamese Dong for that ($1,29 - $2,15)</strong>.</li> </ul> Anyway, there is so much great food out there in Vietnam that we could dedicate an entire article to it!  <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1256\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.pho-soup.jpg\" alt=\"The iconic Pho soup is quite delicious!\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>The iconic Pho soup is quite delicious!</em></div>  <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1257\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20180812_155450.jpg\" alt=\"The Spring Rolls were an extraordinary surprise to our taste glands!\" width=\"4160\" height=\"2340\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>The Spring Rolls were an extraordinary surprise to our taste glands!</em></div>  <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1258\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20180808_131756.jpg\" alt=\"Seafood in Vietnam is awesome!

The beer culture in Vietnam is also very strong, and there is nothing better than the sip of fresh iced beer when it’s smoking hot outside!  Local people enjoy taking some time off in the afternoon for <em>siesta</em> time to enjoy in the sip of coffee and just observing what is going around the neighborhood. As we Balkan people enjoy taking some time off, especially when we were on the road; we made coffee breaks our routine very soon.  We roughly spent </span><b>$154 or 3,581,395 Vietnamese Dong</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on drinks.   That includes: <ul>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coffee (Cà Phê)</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beer (Bia)</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tea (Trà)</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Water (Nước)</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sugar Cane Juice (Nước Mía)</li> </ul> As it’s very humid in most parts of Vietnam during the low season, coffee is served with ice! This makes it incredibly refreshing, and the taste of it is exceptional!   The </span><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide\"><b>process of making drip coffee</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is incredibly satisfying!  Expect to pay for coffee with ice somewhere between </span><b>10,000 - 20,000 Vietnamese Dong ($0,43 - $0,86)</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As it was with food prices, you can expect to pay 30,000 Vietnamese Dong for coffee in the hot tourist zones. Also, egg coffee tends to be more expensive than iced coffee.  <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1213\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20180722_113104.jpg\" alt=\"Iced coffee is just what you need to cool down and recharge for the day ahead!\" width=\"4160\" height=\"2340\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Iced coffee is just what you need to cool down and recharge for the day ahead!</em></div>  Beer is incredibly cheap in Vietnam. Expect to pay </span><b>9,000 - 20,000 Vietnamese Dong ($0,39 - $0,86)</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for 0,3 liters of fresh beer. Make sure to ask ice with your beer; it will make it so much better! If you’re buying beer in the supermarket, it’s usually cheaper than in cafes </span><b>(10,000 - 15,000 Vietnamese Dong or $0,43 - $0,65)</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  <img class=\"wp-image-1330 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.vietnam-beer-1.jpg\" alt=\"Fresh and dirt-cheap beer on the beach - the perfect combination!\" width=\"4488\" height=\"3455\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Fresh and dirt-cheap beer on the beach - the perfect combination!</em></div>  Tea is served everywhere in Vietnam. In most places, <strong>you will get tea for free</strong> with coffee or with your meal. Mostly it’s a sort of green tea that is iced (in Highlands, they serve it warm, as it’s noticeably colder there than in the rest of Vietnam).  <img class=\"wp-image-1331 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.vietnam-tea.jpg\" alt=\"Tea is often served along with coffee - for free!\" width=\"4608\" height=\"3456\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Tea is often served along with coffee - for free!</em></div>  Tea won’t be served for free in regular restaurants, but don’t expect to pay much even there!  <b><i>Note:</i></b><i> In most cafes or restaurants you will see a plastic jug filled with tea. Feel free to treat yourself, as it’s free, fresh and tasty!</i>  Tap water in Vietnam isn’t safe to drink yet. That means that you’ll have to buckle up on bottled water. Thankfully, you can buy bottled water virtually anywhere, as there will always be a stand beside the road or in the towns that have water on sale.  Bottled water isn’t that expensive, and we recommend you to stock up on it; you’re going to need it! The prices range from </span><b>9,000 - 12,000 Vietnamese Dong ($0,39 - $0,65)</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  <b><i>Note:</i></b><i> We recommend you to re-use those plastic bottles instead of throwing them away. In most street food stalls or cafes, there will be a plastic water barrel with a little faucet that you can use to fill up your bottles for free!</i>  Sugar cane juice was an exciting discovery while traveling through Vietnam. It’s an incredibly refreshing drink that really fits great in the moments when you just want to relax and freshen up. Sugar cane juice is made in front of your eyes by crushing the sugar canes with a little crushing machine.  <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1216\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20180802_144219.jpg\" alt=\"Stop by for some Nước Mía to freshen up on the road!\" width=\"4160\" height=\"2340\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Stop by for some Nước Mía to freshen up on the road!</em></div>  When you get the sugar cane juice handed over to you, expect to pay </span><b>10,000 Vietnamese Dong ($0,43)</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for one glass!   Depending on your style, you may allocate more budget on the beverages than us, but either way, it won’t hurt your wallet at all. That’s the charm of experiencing Vietnam on a budget! <h2><b>Accommodation Cost in Vietnam (~$5,72 per day)</b></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-1332 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.trang-an-nature-house.jpg\" alt=\"The definition of the 5$ view?\" width=\"4608\" height=\"3456\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>The definition of the 5$ view?</em></div>  Taking a motorbike road trip and finding the right accommodation is easier than ever thanks to the wonders of the Internet. In most cases, we three used the </span><a href=\"https://www.booking.com\"><b>Booking app</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to find budget-friendly accommodation throughout our road trip.  <em><strong>From cheap, 2-3-star hotels and hostels to homestays with friendly hosts, there is something to choose for every budget!</strong> </em>  If you travel alone, the accommodation costs will be the most significant daily expenses in Vietnam.   <em><strong>But, if you don’t travel alone, you can split those costs! Awesome, isn’t it?</strong></em>  Most foreigners stay in hostels, so it’s an excellent way for a solo traveler to meet some potential travel partners!  <img class=\"wp-image-1333 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Phan-Thiet-bungalows.jpg\" alt=\"The bungalows in Phan Thiet are a bang for you buck!\" width=\"4608\" height=\"3456\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>The bungalows in Phan Thiet are a bang for you buck!</em></div>  The accommodation costs are extra cheap (not the most affordable in Asia though!), especially when split between three people. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We roughly spent </span><b>$128 or 2,976,744 Vietnamese Dong</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the accommodation for 30 days on the road.   We’ve stayed in: <ul>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hostels</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Homestays</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guesthouses</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hotels </li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bungalows</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volunteer Houses</li> </ul> Also, the quality of budget accommodation is also on the level, most of the places where we’ve stayed in offered more value for spent money. Remember, you’re just spending <strong>$5 on average per night</strong>!  Most of them offer <strong>free breakfast in the early morning hours</strong> (between 7 A.M. and 10 A.M.) and of course, free Wi-Fi!  <img class=\"wp-image-1334 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.C4C-House.jpg\" alt=\"The C4C volunteer house in Hanoi has a hammock on the balcony!\" width=\"4160\" height=\"2340\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>The C4C volunteer house in Hanoi has a hammock on the balcony!</em></div>  <b><i>Note:</i></b><i> We stayed for free in volunteer houses in Hanoi and Cau Giat. </span></i><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/starlight-english-center-vietnam\"><b><i>Volunteering while traveling in Vietnam</i></b></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a great way to experience the local culture and save lots of money!

The hosts of the places we’ve stayed in were generally warm, friendly and eager to help out at any time!  <b><i>Note:</i></b><i> Be careful of the check-in and check-out times! Some people will try to get more money out of your wallet if you check-out later than the designated time. Of course, you can bargain your way out of this situation as with most of the similar cases in Vietnam!</i>  Some of the experiences with the various accommodation staff or shalomas, as we loved to call them on this trip: <ul>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drinking rice wine with bungalow staff in Cau Giat after the night of heavy partying with the volunteer crew!</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting a bag of weed for free!</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The guy in Hue making the table for breakfast and getting the Banh Mi in two minutes!</li> </ul> In summary, accommodation costs in Vietnam are ridiculously low, especially when you take the superb hospitality (in most cases!), tidy rooms (in most cases too!) and the extra services you get into the price.  <img class=\"wp-image-1335 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.da-nang-rooftops.jpg\" alt=\"When you get a rooftop all for yourself for 5$, you know that\'s a great deal!\" width=\"4608\" height=\"3456\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>When you get a rooftop all for yourself for 5$, you know that\'s a great deal!</em></div>  <em><strong>Note:</strong> In most of the places we\'ve stayed in, we noticed that there are one-time use toothbrushes and toothpaste!</em>  I’ve been to 5x more expensive accommodations in Europe that offered fewer services than in Vietnam, so this was really a breath of fresh air! <h2><b>Motorbike Price and Maintenance Costs in Vietnam</b></h2> <em><strong>What would be a motorbike trip without actually buying the motorbikes first?</strong></em> Thankfully, Vietnam is swarming with bikes, and that means that supply and demand are ridiculously high!  That also means that finding an affordable motorbike is very easy. But, if you want to ride over 1,000 kilometers through Vietnam, you certainly need to <strong>find a reliable bike</strong>.  During our first days in Hanoi, our primary goal was to find reliable bikes. There are a lot of bike shops all over Hanoi that have automatic, semi-automatic and manual bikes on sale. Anything you want really!  <strong>Learn more: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam\">How to buy the bike that won\'t breakdown in the middle of nowhere?</a></strong>  In the end, we got contacted by an awesome dude called Leo who had an automatic and semi-automatic bike for sale. To be exact: SYM Atilla and Honda Wave. We purchased </span><b>SYM Atilla for $200 and Honda Wave for $350</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. David also got a helmet with his bike.  <img class=\"wp-image-1336 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.atilla-honda-peglica.jpg\" alt=\"Our three machines: Atilla, Honda and Peglica!\" width=\"4608\" height=\"3456\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Our three machines: Atilla, Honda and Peglica!</em></div>  <i>This </span></i><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/882003845187734/\"><b><i>group </i></b></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will help you if you want to buy a reliable motorbike!</i>  We were delighted with these bikes, as we went through various obstacles like poor road constructions, off-road driving through heavy rain, driving through mud; without any major breakdown!  <em>Also, when you can tame the Central Highlands and the Ho Chi Minh Trail with a 14-year old automatic scooter, you know that you invested smartly!</em>  On the other hand, </span><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/motorbike-in-vietnam\"><b>Antonio got his Honda Win as a gift</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. We had the most problems with his bike, as it broke down every once in a while. But, still, the cost of rapidly repairing this bike was still lower than the actual price of Honda Win.  Regarding the maintenance part of the motorbike trip, the essential things are <strong>fuel and oil</strong>. The gas tank on our motorbikes were roughly 7 liters, so, we had to fill up every 120 - 150 kilometers.  Gas price in Vietnam is ridiculously low, compared to our home country of Croatia. Expect to pay about <strong>20,000 Vietnamese Dong ($0,86)</strong> for a liter of fuel. That makes it extremely affordable to take a motorbike trip around Vietnam on a budget!  <img class=\"wp-image-1337 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.gas-pump.jpg\" alt=\"Make sure to fill up your bikes every once in a while on the trusty gas pump!\" width=\"4160\" height=\"2340\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Make sure to fill up your bikes every once in a while on the trusty gas pump!</em></div>  Also, gas stations are always around! Except in Central Highlands and on Ho Chi Minh Trail; make sure to <strong>fill up a few bottles with fuel</strong> if you don’t want to get stranded in the middle of nowhere!  We spent roughly </span><b>$86,71 or 2,015,512 Vietnamese Dong</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for filling up the juice on our motorbikes. Very affordable and yet another encouragement to try out an adventure like this one!  We also mentioned the second pillar of the motorbike maintenance sphere - oil. You have to <strong>change engine oil every 500 - 1000 kilometers</strong> for your engine to work correctly.  <img class=\"wp-image-1338 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.xe-may-vietnam.jpg\" alt=\"The Xe May workshops will gladly check your bike and change engine oil.\" width=\"4608\" height=\"3456\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>The Xe May workshops will gladly check your bike and change engine oil.</em></div>  You can change oil at any motorbike shop (when you see “XE MAY” on the post, you’re at the right place!). Changing oil will roughly cost you <strong>100,000 Vietnamese Dong ($4,3)</strong>.   We had to change engine oil two times, which cost us roughly </span><b>$9,52 or 221,395 Vietnamese Dong</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  What’s the most charming about taking a motorbike trip in Vietnam is that the bikes are insanely easy to sell, as the demand is enormous. David sold his bike after negotiating for <strong>$190</strong>, which was a decent sell. Antonio managed to sell his bike for <strong>$110</strong>, which was even more than decent!  <strong>Learn more: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/sell-motorbike-vietnam\">The art of selling your motorbike in Vietnam!</a></strong>  Motorbike trip is an optimal way to experience Vietnam on a budget, so the right time to do this is now! <h2><b>Other Expenses in Vietnam</b></h2> Of course, you will need to consider other expenses while motorbiking around Vietnam.   If you’re coming to visit in the low season, make sure to invest in a quality raincoat, as you’re going to put it on a lot. When you’re driving through a rainstorm (that are very frequent during low season) it’s a lifesaver, believe us!  <img class=\"wp-image-1339 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Vietnam-Raincoat.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnam Raincoat\" width=\"4160\" height=\"2340\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>It\'s sunshine and rainbows at one moment; blink once and here comes the rain!</em></div>  We invested </span><b>150,000 Vietnamese Dong ($6,45)</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in a quality raincoat each, and they got us through the whole trip from Hanoi to HCMC.  Also, make sure to get some bungee cords for your luggage. A bungee cord should cost no more than </span><b>10,000 Vietnamese Dong ($0,43)</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It will make all the difference regarding your luggage transport on the motorbike.  <img class=\"wp-image-1340 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.bungee-cords-motorbike.jpg\" alt=\"Bungee cords will keep your stuff safe on the back of your bike.\" width=\"4608\" height=\"3456\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Bungee cords will keep your stuff safe on the back of your bike.</em></div>  <b><i>Note:</i></b><i> You may need to invest in a luggage rack if it isn’t already there on the bike, so pay attention to that!</i>  Other than using the motorbike, you will also need to use other transportation means in Vietnam. We recommend getting the </span><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grabtaxi.passenger&amp;hl=hr\"><b>Grab app</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is the equivalent of the Uber app in South East Asia. It’s much cheaper than a taxi (especially when sharing a ride).   Buses are also a cheap way to travel around Hanoi. We used them in a few occasions to get to the city, and the ticket cost only </span><b>5,000 Vietnamese Dong ($0,22)</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  <b><i>Note:</i></b><i> Watch out for “freelance” motorbike taxis! If you end up on one of them, make sure to agree on the price before the ride if you don’t want to get ripped off!</i>  <strong><em>Willing to check out some of the attractions along the way?</em></strong> You’ll have to single out some money for a ticket.   The Paradise Cave complex ticket in Phong Nha National Park costs </span><b>250,000 Vietnamese Dong ($10,82)</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and it’s absolutely worth it!  <img class=\"wp-image-1341 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.phong-nha-jungle.jpg\" alt=\"The Phong Nha hides many a thing in its lush jungle.\" width=\"4608\" height=\"3456\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>The Phong Nha hides many a thing in its lush jungle.</em></div>  <img class=\"wp-image-1342 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.paradise-cave-phong-nha.jpg\" alt=\"Paradise Cave in Phong Nha National Park features the dramatic work of nature.\" width=\"4160\" height=\"2340\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Paradise Cave in Phong Nha National Park features the dramatic work of nature.</em></div>  The ticket for the Hue Imperial City costs </span><b>150,000 Vietnamese Dong ($6,45)</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that includes the majority of the Imperial City (minus the tombs).  <img class=\"wp-image-1343 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.imperial-city-hue.jpg\" alt=\"The Imperial City in Hue is a very interesting place.

Us three got in by bribing a “security guard” for </span><b>100,000 Vietnamese Dong ($4,3)</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regardless the fact that the park is officially closed, but the locals have used the situation to earn some money I guess!  <img class=\"wp-image-1344 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.hue-abandoned-water-park.jpg\" alt=\"You get to explore inside this huge dragon that dominates the Abandoned Water Park in Hue.\" width=\"4608\" height=\"3456\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>You get to explore inside this huge dragon that dominates the Abandoned Water Park in Hue.</em></div>  After driving on a motorbike for a month, getting a massage is a must! We managed to bargain out a full body massage in Phan Thiet with the duration of 1 hour for </span><b>100,000 Vietnamese Dong ($4,30)</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It was truly well worth the money, we must say!  You’re a passionate cigarette smoker and don’t plan on quitting any time soon? Good news for you, as the cigarettes in Vietnam are dirt-cheap! A single 20-pack will cost you from </span><b>20,000 - 30,000 Dong ($0,86 - $1,29)</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  <img class=\"wp-image-1345 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.vietnam-cigarettes.jpg\" alt=\"Cigarettes in Vietnam are damn cheap!

The price goes higher with the quality, and the lowest that we have paid for it was </span><b>500,000 Vietnamese Dong ($21,50)</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for bush </span><b>weed in Da Nang</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1225\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.weed-in-vietnam.jpg\" alt=\"Weed in Vietnam is really easy to get!\" width=\"2340\" height=\"2583\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Weed in Vietnam is really easy to get!</em></div>  <b><i>Note:</i></b><i> In bigger cities, like </span></i><b><i>Hanoi</i></b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span></i><b><i>HCMC</i></b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and Hue, you may get approached by cannabis dealers. Mostly, they will offer you low-quality weed for a high price, so try to bargain out a reasonable deal or back out of the deal. Also, we’ve seen some shady people offering prostitutes and “happy ending massages” too! Make sure to rationalize these deals and take them with a grain of salt before deciding what to do.

Simply use your common sense, and there won\'t be any problems with the authorities as cannabis is generally accepted here in Vietnam.  <strong>Cannabis smoker in Vietnam? Check out our <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/cannabis-in-vietnam\">cannabis guide for Vietnam</a> and <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/weed-in-hanoi\">getting weed in Hanoi</a>.</strong>  Anyway, these are some of the other expenses you may consider while traveling Vietnam on a budget. Having a motorbike eliminates most of the public transport costs, so you save a lot of money on that front. <h2><b>How Would You Rank The Locations By the Expenses?</b></h2> Now, this ranking is mainly subjective, as we obviously didn’t have enough time to experience every destination fully. So, here is the ranking, in descending order: <h3><b>1. Hanoi - 706,333 Vietnamese Dong (~$30) per day</b></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1346 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Hanoi-1.jpg\" alt=\"Hanoi\" width=\"4160\" height=\"2340\" />  Hanoi was the most costly of our destinations, as it was our first destination where we had to buy the bikes and all the necessary gear for the motorbike trip. Anyway, Hanoi is more expensive the more you head into the city center, so keep that information in mind. <h3><b>2. Tam Coc - 672,132 Vietnamese Dong (~$29) per day</b></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1347 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Tam-Coc-2.jpg\" alt=\"Tam Coc\" width=\"4608\" height=\"3456\" />  You can significantly lower your daily costs if you stay and explore the Ninh Binh city. We were cruising around Tam Coc and visited the Mua Caves (you have to pay an entry ticket) and spent most of our money on the breakfast and dinner at our hostel. <h3><b>3. Phong Nha - 660,533 Vietnamese Dong (~$28) per day</b></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1348 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Phong-Nha-1.jpg\" alt=\"Phong Nha\" width=\"4608\" height=\"3456\" />  You can find cheap accommodation in Phong Nha, but there are a lot of restaurants that are more expensive than the local ones. If you want to pay less for food in Phong Nha, just venture to any of nearby villages. Also, be prepared to fill up your gas tank, as the road to all the attractions in the national park (for some, you have to pay an entry ticket) begs to be explored! <h3><b>4. Ho Chi Minh City - 638,000 Vietnamese Dong (~$27) per day</b></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1349 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Saigon-1.jpg\" alt=\"Saigon\" width=\"4160\" height=\"2340\" />  We overspent a bit in HCMC as we booked our hostel while we were on the road toll. When you stay in District 1, be prepared to bargain a lot more as you will have vendors that sell 0,3-liter beer for 30,000 Vietnamese Dongs and a modest rice meal for 60,000 Vietnamese Dong (usually, you can get it for 30,000 Vietnamese Dong).  <strong>Learn more: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam\">Avoiding scams in Vietnam!</a></strong> <h3><b>5. Ha Long - 608,667 Vietnamese Dong (~$26) per day</b></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1350 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Ha-Long-1.jpg\" alt=\"Ha Long\" width=\"4608\" height=\"3456\" />  The beautiful Ha Long Bay can be experienced on a low budget and offer you an authentic experience. We avoided boat tours that are mostly tailored to higher touristic budgets. Instead, we drove to the beach, got some beers, and enjoyed the Bay for ourselves! Also, we spent more money on getting the necessary supplies for our motorbike road trip in the shopping mall.  <strong>Halong on a budget: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/halong-bay-vietnam\">Climb a stunning Bai Tho mountain!</a></strong> <h3><b>6. Nha Trang - 523,000 Vietnamese Dong (~$22) per day</b></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1351 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Nha-Trang.jpg\" alt=\"Nha Trang\" width=\"4160\" height=\"2340\" />  Nha Trang is an exciting beach city that is filled with local and foreign tourists alike. But as with every city in Vietnam, you can squeeze it out on a budget, if you know where to look!  <h3><b>7. Phan Thiet/Mui Ne - 499,500 Vietnamese Dong (~$21) per day</b></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1352 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Phan-Thiet.jpg\" alt=\"Phan Thiet\" width=\"4608\" height=\"3456\" />  Phan Thiet is a perfect place just to lay back and relax. The beach vibes, huge waves, and nice party atmosphere really came in handy to recharge at the end of our road trip. There are a lot of restaurants with great prices, massage parlors, fruit vendors and more. What’s amazing is all of that is just on one street! <h3><b>8. Da Nang - 492,250 Vietnamese Dong (~$21) per day</b></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1353 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Da-Nang-1.jpg\" alt=\"Da Nang \" width=\"4608\" height=\"3456\" />  Living in Da Nang for four days was an awesome experience. The food is generally very cheap, and we stayed in one of the cheapest hostels on our road trip that offered huge value for our money! The beach is very close to the city center. We would say that it was the most liveable city in Vietnam so far. Make sure to check out Mỹ Sơn that is very close to Da Nang! <h3><b>9. Kon Tum - 487,000 Vietnamese Dong (~$21) per day</b></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1239\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_2188.jpg\" alt=\"Kon Tum\" width=\"4608\" height=\"3456\" />  This town in the Central Highlands is special. Not just that it’s much colder than the coastline, but the people are also different. There is a lot to see in Kon Tum and in the villages around it, and it’s perfectly suited to a motorbike cruise! <h3><b>10. Hoi An - 454,000 Vietnamese Dong (~$20) per day</b></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1240\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20180809_182233.jpg\" alt=\"Hoi An\" width=\"4160\" height=\"2340\" />  Hoi An is a place where you have to watch out to not behave like a tourist. It attracts a lot of foreign people every year, and the locals know that; so there is aggressive marketing everywhere! In the outer town areas, you can find some great accommodation for low prices. <h3><b>11. Hue - 434,000 Vietnamese Dong (~$19) per day</b></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1354 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Hue-1.jpg\" alt=\"Hue\" width=\"4608\" height=\"3456\" />  The former capital of Vietnam has a lot of options for budget travelers. The daily cost is amplified with tickets to Imperial City and Abandoned Waterpark and eating out in the westernized restaurant. <h3><b>12. Quy Nhon - 409,000 Vietnamese Dong (~$18) per day</b></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1355 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Quy-Nhon.jpg\" alt=\"Quy Nhon\" width=\"4608\" height=\"3456\" />  A calm beach town that is surprisingly affordable and off the radar for many travelers coming in Vietnam! <h3><b>13. Cau Giat - 209,833 Vietnamese Dong (~$9) per day </b></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1356 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Cau-Giat-1.jpg\" alt=\"Cau Giat\" width=\"4160\" height=\"2340\" />  These are the daily costs that you can expect while staying in highway villages of Vietnam. Great beach, cheap accommodation and food, and excellent coconut coffee! This is the place where the volunteer community is growing.  <hr />  In the end, we surpassed our estimated budget of $500 by almost $150! We made some mistakes on the road, but it was definitely a learning experience.  Nevertheless, you can definitely experience Vietnam on a budget, even lower than ours if you opt-out some of the costs like alcohol and weed.  The tourism industry is still in growth stages, so the <strong>prices are still very affordable</strong>.  Also, make sure to <strong>avoid hot tourist zones</strong> if you want to make it out on a low budget. Who knows, you might learn something from a local perspective…  We would definitely do some things differently regarding the budget, but the bottom line is - even if you make mistakes, you won\'t get ripped off that much if you <strong>use common sense</strong> in most situations.  <em><strong>Experiencing Vietnam on a motorbike is an ultimate way to explore this beautiful country, and the time to do it is now when it\'s still untouched by mass tourism!</strong></em>  <hr />  <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>ENJOYED THIS POST?

If you think that it\'s nearly impossible, just stop a bit and continue reading!  Finding a bike in Vietnam is very easy since the country has around 45 million registered motorcycles on a population of roughly 90 million people!  <em>It roughly means that every second person has a bike, or better said - every bike serves (at least!) two people! How crazy is it, right?</em>  Don’t get excited too soon, as finding the reliable motorbike that will be your true companion around the country can cause few headaches! Locals around the city mainly use motorbikes as the mean of transportation as they don’t usually travel long distances, so the bikes are in better condition than your average ‘<em>backpacker</em>’ motorbike.  We have the experience of buying and maintaining three different bikes and driving a few other bikes. Nothing is certain on the road except one thing - BREAKDOWNS!!!  <em>There were many breakdowns in the middle of nowhere, oil leaks, flat tires, you name it!</em>  We want to share bits of knowledge we gathered from driving 5,000kms around this stunning country and help you in picking the suitable motorbike for your trip!  <em>…because a breakdown in the middle of nowhere isn’t funny at all!</em> <h2><strong>Where to Buy a Motorbike in Vietnam</strong></h2> <img src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.37647027_10215366678136646_2249191630370242560_o-min.jpg\" alt=\"Buying a motorbike in Hanoi\" />  You will most likely start your trip in either Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) and these cities are the biggest hubs of backpackers and also the major starting point for travelers who’re about to travel Vietnam by motorbike. The motorbike market in these two cities is huge which can be very tricky as you can choose between million bikes!  We didn’t have any prior mechanic experience when it comes to motorbikes, so it was a bit tougher to pick a reliable bike. We had a bit of luck to have prior experience in Vietnam with motorbikes and many local friends, so we were poured with a dozen of advice when it comes to buying the bike.  The usual advice is to buy a motorbike in Hanoi and sell it in Ho Chi Minh city. The reason is that China is nearer to Hanoi and many bikes are coming from China, so the price is lower as there are not as many logistics costs as in Saigon.  People will tell you that you can even earn money by <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/sell-motorbike-vietnam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">selling the motorbike</a> in Saigon. It wasn\'t our case! A bit of money was lost, but nothing significant!  We didn’t have much trouble when buying a motorbike in Hanoi, and it took us one afternoon to do a test drive and close a deal.  We posted on the Facebook group called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/882003845187734/?jazoest=2651001198210198991078266688476521208145121871005072709710597771068410795721211036611711111011757121104508065655865100121671179812084106887352112104871148310185109108827166709056538110772498385995474697287997810712171119\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vietnam Backpackers Travel and Sales</a> that we’re looking for a motorbike, and we were showered with deals in a few minutes.  We decided to check a Mr. Leo agency as the guy had one automatic and a semi-automatic motorbike at the time.  We spent around 3 hours checking the bikes and doing test drives since David never drove anything except a bicycle. Anyway, it was a successful afternoon as we got two bikes and we were ready for our motorbike trip around Vietnam!  So, to answer the question of where to buy a motorbike in Vietnam - it really doesn’t matter as you’ll probably going to start your journey from Saigon or Hanoi. The market is enormous in both cities, and you shouldn’t have any struggle while finding a motorbike in these cities.  The best advice we can give you is to never to believe people who say that they never experienced a breakdown on the road!  <em>The chances for that are close to zero!</em> <h2><strong>Reliable Motorbike Types in Vietnam</strong></h2> There are so many different types of motorcycles in Vietnam, so sometimes it can be very confusing when picking a suitable motorbike for you.  <em>Here are the most usual motorbikes travelers get for the Vietnamese trip:</em> <h3><strong>Manual</strong></h3> <img src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20180821_113837-min.jpg\" alt=\"Manual Sufat Win\" />  Backpackers usually go for ‘Honda’ Win. Please note that the original Honda Win is rare to find since Honda stopped to produce these bikes almost ten years ago. They sold that series to Chinese and Vietnamese companies, so now, you have many different versions of Win motorbike. None of these bikes is Honda since real Honda Win will cost you around $1000.  <strong><em>Funny fact:</em> </strong><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/motorbike-in-vietnam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Antonio got his bike as a gift in Hanoi!</a>  A ‘Honda’ Win’s usually goes from $150 - $500. We advise you to not go for the cheapest one since these bikes have so many kilometers under the belt and you can expect many breakdowns on the road with the cheapest ones. Instead, aim for the bikes that are in a $300 price range. You can get a decent manual bike in that range!  There are many different brands of Wins now, but from experience, we think Sufat and new Detech (2016+)<strong> </strong>are the most reliable. Antonio was driving Sufat from Hanoi to Saigon without any significant problems on the machine. The only problem he had was the electric, so he had issues with starting a bike sometimes. Also, the indicators usually don’t work on these bikes, so be careful when it comes to checking the fuel. His Sufat left him without the gas in the most remote areas a few times!  Don’t be like Antonio and always fill your tank! <h3><strong>Semi-automatic</strong></h3> <img class=\"wp-image-5921 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e8337ab695ff.jpg\" alt=\"Semi automatic Honda Wave\" width=\"1131\" height=\"846\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Honda Waves are very common bikes in Vietnam. This one is a crazy good bike and also, it\'s a real Honda so you should expect to pay a bit more. We didn\'t have much trouble with this one on the road.</div>  We found out that semi-automatic bikes are very reliable but slightly more expensive than manuals. Lovel was driving Honda Wave, and he didn’t have any major breakdowns except a broken chain and few problems with a gearbox that he changed on the road.  The bike cruises like a charm, and you can easily reach 90 km/h which is ideal for many roads around the country. The indicators work, so you don’t need to worry about fuel consumption. Also, the bike has a lot of strength so climbing the steep mountains won’t cause obstacles to a well-maintained Wave. The Waves are delightful and comfortable to drive, but be careful that you’re buying a real Honda since there are many versions of Chinese waves as Lifan.  Yamaha Sirius and Taurus are another good to go semi-automatic bikes, but they will cost a bit more, and their fuel consumption isn’t as good as Wave. So if you’re thinking about buying a semi-automatic, definitely go for a Wave. <h3><strong>Automatic</strong></h3> <img class=\"wp-image-5920 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e833706da177.jpg\" alt=\"SYM Atilla\" width=\"1127\" height=\"844\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> An automatic bike that was the most reliable bike of our crew! Not a single breakdown on the road. Just put the new oil every 1,000 km and tightening the chain.</div>  An automatic type of motorbike is the most suitable for total beginners who never had any experience with the bikes or people who don’t want to think about changing the gears while focusing on chaotic traffic around.  Automatic bikes aren’t the most comfortable bikes and there is not much space, so prepare for a bent back and be ready to put some money for a massage here and there.  Also, when hitting the hills with an automatic, you will obviously have a much harder time as you have no control over the transmission. Driving on the challenging Ho Chi Minh Trail was really slow on this bike.  David was driving SYM Atilla along the way and he passed 3,500 km with the bike without a single breakdown! Without a single breakdown, you heard it right!  He even didn’t have a flat tire or broken chain. Literally nothing except changing the oil every 1,000 kilometers.  Here and there, you may end up with some slight issues with the electric starter, but that\'s not a permanent issue. Also, scooters have a kickstart for situations like this.  If you’re thinking about getting an automatic bike, then we advise you to go with SYM Atilla or Honda Lead (a bit more expensive) as these bikes are very reliable, but once they break down, you will have a hard time to find a mechanic who can help you! <h2><strong>Checklist Before Buying a Motorbike in Vietnam</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5922 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e833864e4408.jpg\" alt=\"Resting the bike in the middle of nowhere\" width=\"1134\" height=\"844\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> We didn\'t have any mechanic knowledge before buying our motorbikes, but there are many things you can check on your own; even without any knowledge or experience about the bikes!</div>  These tips will definitely help people without any mechanic experience since we’re the same, but it turned out these things can save you a lot of time and money on the road, so let’s start: <ul>   <li>Check the condition of both tires. You can put the price down if the tires are well-used and you should change the used tires as the roads can be very slippery in some sections.</li>   <li>Are front and rear signals working?</li>   <li>Are front and rear lights working? Does the brake indicator on the back work?</li>   <li>Always check out the condition of your horn and loudness level of it! It’s one of the most important things on your motorbike!</li>   <li>When doing a test drive, try out your brakes and get a feeling of tightness.</li>   <li>Try an electric starter as well as kickstarter.</li>   <li>Drive a bit and leave the motorbike on the stand. When the engine gets a bit warmer, you shouldn’t see any oil leaks below. If you notice any leaks after a short ride, it’s the sign that the engine isn’t in the best condition.</li>   <li>Put the bike on the center stand and rotate the rear wheel to see if it’s centered.</li>   <li>Drive in all gears and check out if there is an anomaly when changing the gears. The gears should change without much effort and you can also put in the neutral gear once you’re in 1st and 2nd gear (manual bikes).</li>   <li>Check out the suspension when you’re braking and also see if there is any rust or cracks. When you’re driving everything should be smooth without any wobbling and vibrations.</li>   <li>The bike shouldn’t have any sprayings on the machine since it can be an indicator that the seller is trying to hide a broken part from you.</li>   <li>Double-check the numbers on the blue card. Both numbers should match the machine and the case.</li> </ul> These tips can help you so much in filtering bad bikes! If the bike passed all the checks, then there is a huge possibility it’s the right bike you should buy for your trip.  Another great tip when buying is to have a local friend who knows people and who can help you with negotiating the price. Believe us, the language barrier can be a deal-breaker here! <h2><strong>Bike Accessories That Will Make Your Life Easier</strong></h2> <p id=\"kIKrNbr\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5923 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e83396293e31.jpg\" alt=\"Luggage rack and bungees are crucial\" width=\"1439\" height=\"872\" /></p> There are some things that will save you a lot of time and hustle on the road if your bike has it. It’s not a major deal breaker if the bike doesn’t come with these things, but always ask for it, or bargain the price. <ul>   <li>Bungee cords are necessary since you need to tie down your luggage to the rack. Head to local markets and get the strongest ones. Also, keep in mind cords tend to break, so always go for more. One cord costs up to 20,000 VND on the market.</li>   <li>Many sellers will usually give you a helmet with the bike, but the quality won\'t protect you at all. Invest in a proper full-face helmet!</li>   <li>A luggage rack is essential since you\'ll most likely carry luggage with you. Double-check for the rust and strength of the rack! You can get a new one for about 300,000 VND.</li>   <li>A cell phone holder comes handy since you can fix your phone and navigate without constant stopping. This is a major time saver!</li>   <li>Chain and a lock for the safety of your bike. This comes in handy when you’re doing day trips and you don’t park your bike in a safe place. In the big cities, thefts are common, so always secure your bike with the lock or park on the secured parking.</li> </ul> These are just some of the things that will ease up things a bit when you\'re on the road! <h2><strong>Maintenance Before and On the Road</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5924 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e833a5d4a4b2.jpg\" alt=\"Oil change in Vietnam\" width=\"1409\" height=\"897\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Always be sure to have your oil level checked and don\'t forget to change the oil. It\'s cheap and it will give your bike enough juice to drive you through the most intense terrains around the country.</div>  Remember one thing when getting second-hand Vietnam motorcycles - these bikes passed the same trip you’re planning to do hundreds of times!  Many bikes didn’t have proper maintenance and you want to be sure that you start off your trip right and check everything on your bike.  <em>Here are the things we advise you to check and change before starting your epic ride:</em> <ul>   <li>Change the oil and clean the engine (500 - 1,000 km)</li>   <li>Check out the mirrors and all the screws/bolts on the engine and frame</li>   <li>Test your brakes and adjust them if necessary. Also, changing the brake pads will help a lot!</li>   <li>Change plugs</li>   <li>Tighten and lubricate the chain</li> </ul> <em>TA-DA! Your motorbike is ready for the trip!</em>  Once you hit the road, you don’t want to torture your ride. You should always take good care and visit a mechanic every once in a while.  <em>Here are the maintenance things you should consider doing once you hit the road:</em> <ul>   <li>Change the oil every 500 - 1000 km</li>   <li>When you change the oil, always tighten the chain and adjust the brakes</li>   <li>Put extra air to the tires and check out the condition of your tires</li>   <li>Check out the bolts and loose parts and tighten them</li> </ul> That’s it! Do these things and you are totally ready for this trip!  Here are the costs of common repairs: <ul>   <li>Oil change with chain lubricating, tightening and brake adjusting - up to 120k</li>   <li>Spark plug - 70k</li>   <li>Flat tire (inner tire) - 100k</li>   <li>Changing the inner and outer tire - 300k</li>   <li>Battery - 250k - 350k</li>   <li>Suspension - 300k</li>   <li>Brake pads - 100k</li>   <li>Exhaust - 250k</li>   <li>Front light - 200k</li>   <li>Backlight - 100k</li>   <li>Chain - 150k</li>   <li>Carburetor - 250k</li>   <li>Cylinder - 400k</li>   <li>Brake or clutch handle - 70k</li>   <li>Set of mirrors - 90k</li>   <li>Changing the clutch - 500k</li>   <li>Front rim - 300k</li>   <li>Back rim - 500k</li>   <li>Complete new gearbox - around 1 mil</li>   <li>Alternator - 200k</li> </ul> Always ask for the price upfront as a mechanic won’t be able to manipulate you on your ignorance.

The adventure you’ll experience is merely the thing you’re going to talk about for years and remember the moments with the smile on your face for a whole life.   <strong><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam\">Once you’ve got your motorbike</a></strong> ready to hit the road, got all the accessories and things you might need, it’s time to talk about the laws and police in Vietnam.   There are many talks on different groups between backpackers and locals about the traffic police in Vietnam. It’s a significant topic to cover since there is a possibility that the traffic police will pull you over at some point of your trip.  Find a comfortable place, and read carefully as this guide will help you to avoid unwanted trouble or if inevitable, pay the <em>‘fine’</em> that is close to nothing.  <em>Let’s start with the type of the police…</em> <h2><b>How Does the Traffic Police Look Like</b></h2> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1382\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.traffic-police-in-vietnam.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnamese traffic police\" width=\"3504\" height=\"2336\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Traffic police wear yellow uniforms, and you can see \'CSGT\' on their vehicles, helmets, and uniforms.</em></div>  The most straightforward description of traffic police is <strong>yellow uniforms</strong>. Usually, you will see many police stops and controls in the big cities. They ensure that the traffic is flowing without interruptions. Sometimes they are staying in the middle of busy intersections and helping with the flow of traffic.  The acronym for traffic police in Vietnam is CSGT. You can see that sign on their vehicles, helmets and checkpoint houses. In the cities, there are many checkpoints where officers usually stay, checking the documents and pull over people.  Their job is to enforce the traffic law and ensure proper traffic flow. Except for these duties, they can’t do anything more since the other responsibilities are delegated to another <strong><a href=\"https://www.citypassguide.com/en/travel/vietnam/blog/blog/how-to-identify-the-different-police-in-vietnam\">type of police</a></strong>.   Every police officer should have a blue ID card visible on the right part of the chest showing their name, rank, number, and department. Like in every country, if the police stop you, <strong>don’t forget to take a photo or write down details from their ID.</strong> <h2><b>Most Usual Cases Why People Get Pulled Over</b></h2> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1385\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Webp.net-resizeimage.jpg\" alt=\"Don\'t forget to wear helmets and avoid alcohol on the road\" width=\"1336\" height=\"1002\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Don\'t forget to wear a helmet, and avoid alcohol on the road!</em></div>  <em>There are many cases why the police pull over people in Vietnam and one of the most common are:</em> <ul>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Not complying with the traffic rules</strong> - it usually includes driving through the red light, driving in the wrong direction, failure to use signals when taking a turn or speeding over the limit. Check out the list of fines for failing to follow the traffic rules. </li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Regular traffic checks</strong> - police usually perform their checks in the big cities during the rush hours as there are many people in the traffic. Police randomly stop people to check the motorbike papers and licenses. You need to be sure that you have a valid <strong>Blue Card and international (Vietnamese) driving license</strong>! If you fail to show one of these, you will probably need to pay a fine, or a bribe or they can even confiscate your motorbike!</li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Tourist traps</strong> - there are few tourist traps where police aim tourists to get the juicy bribes from them. We will talk about these places later in the article, and these are easy to avoid, so don’t worry so much!</li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>No reason at all</strong> - yeah, that’s Vietnam, and it is usually the most common case! Police will stop you claiming you did something that you didn’t and try to get money from your pocket.</li> </ul> These four cases are the most common, and usually, you will experience one or more of these during your time driving around Vietnam.   <em>Maybe it sounds like a horror story to you now, but don’t worry, you can avoid many of them or get out of the situation without much hustle!</em> <h2><b>What to Do If You Get Pulled Over?</b></h2> <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8odfKVx-pPg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  During our trip, Lovel was the only one who’ve got pulled over by police. They let him go without any complications. We can say he was a lucky guy!  <em>So, what happens and what’s the process for not so lucky travelers?</em>  Well, based on many stories and experiences from other travelers, no matter what’s the case police pulled you over, there are few possible scenarios.  <ul>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When police pull you over, they will usually ask you for the documentation including a blue card and driving license. In the countryside, when the police see a foreigner, they will just wave you to go since <strong>the language barrier</strong> is real and it will take a lot of time to get some money from foreigners, so they usually don’t mind.</li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don’t have proper documents, they will ask you to pay the fine (without a ticket), and usually, they start with the price set on 1 mil. VND, but they <strong>settle for 200k or even less</strong>. This is the bribe, and it’s the easiest way to get away from the police since paying the ticket is the whole process, and you need to go to the station, fill the documents, and in the end pay much more money and lose so much time. If you can’t avoid spending the money while encountering the police, the best way may be paying the bribe. </li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you settle everything with the officer, they will let you continue your trip!</li> </ul> The process is really that straightforward, and it won’t last for a long if police randomly stop you.  If you’ve got stopped by a police trap, then expect to pay much more without bargaining for the price. Also, in police traps, there is a huge possibility that they will <strong>confiscate your motorbike</strong>.  <h2><b>How to Deal with Police Traps</b></h2> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1386\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.prepare-dongs.jpg\" alt=\"Prepare dongs to settle the situation\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Prepare Dongs to settle the situation with the police.

They may be a bit longer, but ultimately it will save you time and money.   <em>What happens if you get stopped by a police trap?</em>  Well, you’re not lucky since these police officers are basically there to make a lot of money through bribes. There is a huge possibility that you will only get out of the situation by paying the tremendous bribe.

Be sure that you comply with all the traffic rules, e.g. don’t speed, wear a helmet, use signals if turning, etc.  <em>If you know that you didn’t do anything wrong and you have all the proper documentation with you that enables you to drive legally in Vietnam, then don’t worry…</em>  <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pcojyqD4ziI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  At first, try to bargain. If it’s not going in the direction you’d like to, then simply ask for the ticket. The police will hesitate to give it to you at first as it takes time. They could earn much more money at that time, so they will usually let you go.  If they write a ticket, don’t forget to write down all the information from their uniforms! Especially if you know that you didn’t do anything wrong. Also, during the whole time <strong>don’t speak English</strong> (it’s helpful if you’re not a native English speaker). Or simply, use the accent and give them <em>\"I don\'t understand!\"</em> on everything they say!  They will usually try to scare you down with tickets and talk. If they see you’re confident and you know what are you doing with their info, they will just let you go. It always works! <h2><b>Tips to Successfully Dealing with Vietnamese Police</b></h2> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1388\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.dealing-with-traffic-police.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnamese traffic police on streets\" width=\"1024\" height=\"761\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Don\'t panic and be calm when dealing with Vietnamese police. Everything is going to be fine!</em></div>  Getting pulled over by the police isn’t the thing you can control. You can always live with the fact that one day you might get pulled over. It’s nothing special, but having some tactics at hand will help you tremendously. You will definitely save you time and money in return.   <em>Here are some tips we learned from our trip:</em> <ul>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have two wallets. Hide the main wallet and have another wallet with <strong>200k - 500k on you</strong>. The best is to buy the gas or other things with the money from that wallet, so you break the bills in smaller bills. That will look more realistic than if you just have one bill note in your wallet. In case police pull you over, you just say it’s all the money you have, and police will usually accept it and leave you.</li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always bargain for the price since they will give you a huge price at the beginning, but they usually <strong>settle for around 200k VND</strong>.</li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always <strong>avoid tickets if you don’t have all the valid documents!</strong> That way, you’re 100% sure that you didn’t do anything wrong in the traffic. </li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When pulled over, <strong>speak broken English or even better, speak some other language</strong>. Also, you can act dumb if they speak English and they will probably leave you since they don’t have time to hustle with a foreigner.</li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wear tourist clothes, so even if they notice you, they won’t mind stopping you. Majority of people in the traffic are wearing long sleeves to protect their skin from the sun, dust, and dirt. We advise to put a sunscreen and just wear a T-shirt, and other tourist clothes and police will recognize you as a tourist. </li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just <strong>drive away if they wave their bat at you</strong>. If they start chasing you, simply stop and tell them you didn’t see or notice they are stopping you since in your country this is a different process. Act dumb again!</li> </ul> That’s it! Follow these tips and your dealings with police will mostly end up successfully!  <hr />  Believe us; it’s not a horror story to deal with traffic police. They won’t bother so much with foreign backpackers. If they pull you over though, just use the strategies from the article and you will be more than fine. <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Do you have any experiences with Vietnamese police?

It is a very attractive city for expats where you can see a vibrant community is growing each day. Many expats are getting work permits that enable them to live in Vietnam for an extended time without getting a new visa and go through a whole documentation process, but for some people, doing a visa run is still a harsh reality.   Da Nang is located in central Vietnam where the country is very narrow and it reaches around 100 km in the width. There are many remote border crossings around, but only Lao Bao is an international one where you can do a quick visa run to Laos.   The whole process is pretty straightforward and everything is going like a charm since the border is dealing with many foreigners on a daily basis. The route to reach the border crossing from Da Nang is very scenic and historically important, so we’re going to share the process of getting your new Vietnamese visa along with the route and ways to reach Lao Bao border.   <em>Let’s start with the documentation and process of getting your new Vietnamese visa!</em> <h2><b>Documents You Need Before Heading to Lao Bao</b></h2> Before doing a visa run, be sure that you have all the documents for a new visa application. Gathering all documentation is very easy and it won’t take you much time or money, but be sure to double-check everything!  <strong><em>Documents you need:</em></strong> <ul>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invitation letter</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two passport size photos</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Passport</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Money for Laos visa</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Money for Vietnam visa</li> </ul> <em><strong>Basically, these 5 things on the list are everything you’ll need to have on you when heading to Lao Bao!</strong></em>  <strong>Details: <a href=\"https://www.givevolunteers.org/wp-content/uploads/laos_visa_information_1.10.17.pdf\">Laos visa forms, fees and documentation!</a></strong>  <strong>Details: <a href=\"https://www.vietnam-immigration.org.vn/faqs/view/where-can-i-download-a-visa-application-form.html\">Vietnam visa forms, fees and documentation!</a></strong>  It’s effortless to gather all the documents, but it’s recommended to start thinking on time when it comes to documentation since getting an invitation letter can take up to one week as you need to have an original letter with the stamp with you!  Heading to another international border? Read our ultimate <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/visa-run-vietnam\"><strong>Vietnam visa run guide</strong></a>! <h2><b>How to Get an Invitation Letter in Da Nang</b></h2> An invitation letter is a sponsorship letter provided by a company. If you’re working for a company then you will most likely get the letter sponsored by your company, so you don’t need to worry about it.   For others who’re not working with a Vietnamese company, you need to figure out how to get the invitation letter (sounds harsh, but in reality, it\'s a piece of cake!).   There are many companies that are offering invitation letter services, but the majority of them are very <strong>limited when it comes to the border options and it takes much time for the post to deliver the original letter to your address</strong>.   We were having a hard time finding a reliable company in Da Nang that provides with the invitation letter for Lao Bao. After a few days of looking and talking with expats, we found <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lynn.visaviet.1\"><strong>Lynn from Da Nang</strong></a>!  A lovely lady provides <strong>invitation letters specifically for Lao Bao</strong> and one more amazing thing about her service - she provides you with filled application forms to save your time on the border!  The price of the letter is <strong>$25</strong>. She will deliver the original letter to your address and if you don’t have dollars, they accept VND by the exchange rate on the current day.  <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Transportation Options From Da Nang to Lao Bao</b></h2> There are few transportation options when it comes to reaching Lao Bao border which is always a perk when you’re living in a huge city. It really depends on your budget and time which option you’re going to pick, so we’re going to introduce you with all options.  <h3><b>Taking a Public Bus</b></h3> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1502\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.37954999436_282780208b_k.jpg\" alt=\"sleeper bus in vietnam\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>An iconic red sleeper bus! If you\'re not driving inside, be careful of these furious buses in the traffic!</em></div>  Taking a public bus is the cheapest option, but also it will take most of your time. You need to go to Da Nang bus terminal and find Lao Bao counter. Be sure that you’re getting a direct ticket to Lao Bao as there won’t be any stops until Dong Ha. If you take a normal ticket, the bus will be crappy, overloaded and with hundreds of stops. That kind of trip can last for a day!   The bus drive will take <strong>about 6 hours (stops included)</strong> to reach Lao Bao international border.  <strong><a href=\"https://www.danangbus.com/services/sleeper-bus-booking/sleeper-bus-routes/from-danang-to-laos/danang-to-lao-bao-border/sleeper-bus-from-danang-to-laobao-border/\">Check out all the details about the buses and schedule</a>.</strong>  Another option that gives you a bit more flexibility is getting the bus directly to Dong Ha and then hire a private shuttle to the border. It’s a bit more expensive, but it won’t break your bank, especially if you’re in a rush with a time. <h3><b>Hiring a Private Car or Shuttle</b></h3> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1503\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.4955048028_9d8e95fd9f_b.jpg\" alt=\"private car in Vietnam\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Getting to Lao Bao by car is a very flexible way, but it will cost you a lot. The best way is to have a group of people who are sharing </em>costs<em> of the car!</em></div>  The option to hire a car or shuttle from Da Nang is possible, but it can be a bit more expensive, especially if you don’t have a group of people going together. Visa van has the option, on certain dates, to organize a <strong>group tour to the border and back for $30 per person</strong>. It’s an amazing deal and you’re done with everything <strong>in 12 hours</strong>.   They also have a private driver, if you can’t go in their organized dates, but that service <strong>costs 2.5 million VND</strong>. It’s very expensive if you’re going alone, but if you’re going with few people, then it can be the best option for you when it comes to budget and time.   <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DaNangVisaVan/\">Check Visa Van on Facebook!</a></strong>  <em><strong>Note: </strong>We\'re not affiliated with them and we’re not getting any compensation mentioning the company. We tried their services and we’re more than happy what they did for the low price. Definitely a recommendation when it comes to doing a visa run from Da Nang!</em>  Hiring a driver can be a bit costly, but you are totally flexible when it comes to timing since there are <strong>no stops and driver will usually take the fastest route to Lao Bao</strong>.  <h3><b>Driving Your Motorbike</b></h3> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1495\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20181128_143828.jpg\" alt=\"Honda Wave at Lao Bao\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Antonio\'s beloved Honda at the entrance of Lao Bao international border.</em></div>  Driving a motorbike can be a bit tricky, especially for people who’re still not comfortable with Vietnamese traffic. Antonio did his visa run driving the motorbike to Lao Bao. When driving there, you’re going to pass through amazing passes (Hai Van), driving around stunning nature, stumbling upon random waterfalls, experiencing a local life around Quang Tri province and having your costs under control.   The biggest concern when it comes to a driving motorbike is the safety of course and time consumed. For the budget, you’re in charge of it since you only need to spend on the fuel and maintenance of the motorbike. Everything else is up to you.  <strong>Further Read: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget\">A Budget Breakdown for Biking Around Vietnam</a></strong>  When it comes to time, you will probably need a whole day if you want to do a visa run in one day. Antonio took three days since he was exploring the province and the roads. Quang Tri is the most bombed province during the war and it has huge historical meaning, so driving and going around the sites can teach you a lot.   Antonio was really unlucky as the weather was terrible, so he stayed in Dong Ha for a night and the next day he continued his trip to Lao Bao.   Driving to Dong Ha took about 6 hours with few stops and rain during the whole trip. From Dong Ha to Lao Bao, expect to <strong>drive 2 - 3 hours of chilling drive</strong>. The road there is amazing and the way provides you with crazy beautiful scenery!  <em>In the further text, we’re going to provide you with a detailed description of the route from Da Nang to Lao Bao and back!</em> <h2><b>The Process of Getting a New Vietnamese Visa</b></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-1494 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20181128_141141.jpg\" alt=\"Lao Bao international border\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Entrance to Lao Bao border from Vietnam side.</em></div>  Well, the process is pretty straightforward and easy since the immigration process many foreigners there, so the whole process is well-organized for Vietnamese standards. Also, some officers can speak a bit of English which makes the whole process much easier!  <em><strong>So, once you get to the border, the process is next:</strong></em> <ol>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go to Laos side first and there is a small house with an immigration officer who will check your documents and invitation letter. The guy will stamp you out of Vietnam. This is where you do a STAMP OUT OF VIETNAM.</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go to the next house which is just a few steps left from the first one and get the application for Laos visa. Fill in the form first!</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go to LAOS VISA ON ARRIVAL and provide the officer with the application form, $35 and the photo for the passport. Our advice is to have dollars with you since they will charge you on a very bad exchange rate if you’re paying in VND. Once you get a sticker and the stamp, you’re ready to go again to the Vietnamese side.</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go to LAOS EXIT STAMP and give the passport to the officer. They will check your invitation letter for Vietnam before giving you a stamp.</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go to the next officer who will provide you with the application form for Vietnamese visa. Once you’re done with filling the form, you just need to pay for your visa and the officer will put the sticker in your passport. </li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go to VIETNAM ENTRY STAMP (next to the officer who gives you Laos exit stamp) and give him the passport. The officer will give you all the stamps and you’re ready to go! Just be sure to check out all the stamps and see if everything is matching.</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pick up your motorbike in front of the immigration office and you will need to present your passport to another immigration officer outside. You’re ready to go! </li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Congratulations! You’ve just got a new Vietnamese visa! </li> </ol> Yeah, that’s the whole process once you get to Lao Bao border. Believe us it’s very straightforward, but it can take a bit of time since the border is usually busy.   It took <strong>about 1 hour for the whole process</strong> when Antonio was going. That time, it wasn’t so busy, but there were many locals getting in and out of the country.   <em>Plan your time accordingly and good luck!</em>  <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Traveling from Da Nang to Lao Bao By Motorbike</b></h2> <iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1FnIWayHl8b1dGsfTyvf3dUVuEM1nGFet\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></iframe>  In this section, we’re going to provide you with details about the route from Da Nang to Lao Bao. Please have in mind it was raining heavily when Antonio did a visa run, so he avoided the coastal drive. Probably the whole route would be more scenic if he added a bit of coastal ride, but anyway, the route he took was not so busy at that time, and it provided some spectacular views that add up to an overall driving experience.  In this part, we’re going to separate the whole journey into few sections, so we can give you more information and visual content on each section of the journey. Also, it can give you a more organized outlook of the journey so you can decide which parts or sections you’d like to take if you decide to do a visa run by motorbike.  <h3><b>Passing Hai Van</b></h3> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1504\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Da-Nang-74.jpg\" alt=\"Overlooking Hai Van Pass\" width=\"4608\" height=\"3456\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Enjoying the view at the top of Hai Van pass.</em></div>  Depending on your starting location, the route may differ a bit. Anyway, you need to complete Hai Van Pass in order to get to Lao Bao. There is another route that heads directly to the west from Da Nang, but it’s a very long one and it doesn’t make much sense to take it if you’re lacking the time.   People who’re starting the journey either from Hoi An or Da Nang should take the <strong>coastal road named Nguyen Tat Thanh</strong> which will give you stunning views over Da Nang bay and will show you how local fishermen lives. Once you hit that road, on your right you will see stunning Hai Van mountain overlooking the whole city. You just follow the road and at the end of the road, there is 90-degree turn left that will connect you to infamous QL1.   At that point, QL1 is usually busy since trucks and buses are getting outside the city and when you combine that with the busy outskirts of Da Nang, you get a very tricky situation to drive in. Be extra careful there! Just follow the road and you will get to the point where you’ll slowly climb to Hai Van. Every kilometer will give you better and better views over the city.  <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z8-B-b-2Cr8&\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  The pass is always busy and the curvy road makes it very dangerous since there are many buses, trucks, and cars who’re overtaking, so don’t drive recklessly and you will be fine. Once you reach the top of Hai Van Pass, you can chill a bit while enjoying stunning looks over Da Nang city.   That’s the first section of the journey and you roughly cover about 30 kilometers reaching the top of Hai Van Pass. Lao Bao border is about <strong>260 kilometers away from Da Nang</strong>, so there is a lot more to cover! <h3><b>Lang Co and Detouring Hue</b></h3> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1505\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_1492-1.jpg\" alt=\"Road detouring Hue\" width=\"4608\" height=\"3456\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Once you pass Hai Van mountain, there is an infamous QL1 with stunning views of Bach Ma mountains.</em></div>  When you reach the top of Hai Van Pass and starting to descend the mountain, you will be presented with stunning views, river streams, waterfalls, and stunning infinite ocean view. Just drive slowly as the road conditions aren’t the best and usually the road is a bit slippery, even on the sunny days since there is some oil, mud, and sand on the road.   When you reach the bottom of the mountain you will get to the small fishermen town called Lang Co. You will recognize it by a small river and a huge bridge circling around the river. After you pass the bridge, you’ll get in front of the Hai Van tunnel entrance. Be careful driving around there since it’s <strong>very busy with trucks and buses</strong> that usually don’t pay much attention to motorbike drivers.   Stay on QL1 and just drive carefully since you’re going to drive on that road for a long time now. The road conditions are relatively good, but the traffic is usually busy since this road connects Hue and Da Nang. This section is a bit boring since it’s just a straight road without not so much to see. In the beginning, there is a huge lake and the coastal drive with the smell of pine trees in the air, but afterward, it’s just a highway passing through small towns and villages on the way.  <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1509\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20181127_145116.jpg\" alt=\"Detour around Hue\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Detour around Hue offers few amazing spots and wild rivers!</em></div>  At one point, you should turn right and just continue to follow QL1. If you continue to drive straight, you will end up in Hue, which isn’t a mistake, but you probably want to avoid the busy city and take a detour instead.   Antonio just stayed on QL1 and did a detour around Hue. The road is very dangerous since it’s narrow and trucks are the main vehicles in the traffic. There are few gas stations and parking lots on the way, and nothing more.   Just stick to QL1 and you will soon reach the town in front of Hue. After that, you’re just going to stick to QL1 till you reach Dong Ha. There are not many things to see in this section, but there are few towns where you can rest and refuel your energy. Don’t forget to try their iconic Bun Bo Hue!  <h3><b>Dong Ha to Lao Bao</b></h3> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-1506\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20181128_155301.jpg\" alt=\"Dong Ha to Lao Bao\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>The way from Dong Ha to Lao Bao is filled with the views like this one!</em></div>  Once you reach Dong Ha, it’s time to refuel yourself with amazing food and good coffee. The city itself isn’t much interesting, but the vibe and people there are amazing! There are a few amazing coffee places where you can chill a bit and also, the food around the center is delicious and relatively cheap, even compared to Da Nang. It was very strange when Antonio mentioned he had trouble finding a Banh Mi around Dong Ha!  In the city, there are few amazing homestays if you decide to stay there for a night and continue your trip the next day. Antonio stayed two nights at Hoa Phuong Guesthouse. The guest house is run by the family and they are very friendly and hospitable. They can cook a few meals from the menu, but the value isn’t the best for the price you pay. Also, the room was cozy and very clean and for the price of about <strong>130k per night</strong>, it was definitely a good deal!  The most pleasurable driving experience starts once you hit the road from Dong Ha in the direction to Lao Bao. The whole route is <strong>about 70 kilometers</strong> and if you’re starting from Dong Ha, you don’t need to rush and you can just take your time to explore the beauty of Quang Tri province. Along the road, you will stumble upon many historic places from the war since this part of the province was the most bombed and also the bloodiest battles were held there. That was the northernmost province of South Vietnam at that time.   <em><strong>The</strong> <strong>road conditions are amazing since there are not many holes or construction works and also traffic isn’t heavy</strong></em>.   When you combine these conditions of the road with stunning curvy road surrounded by valleys and mountain ranges in the distance, wild river streams, waterfalls, and crazy beautiful views, you get the perfect driving experience!  <em>There are few pictures showing the memorable parts of the route to Lao Bao and also the videos so you can see the beauty yourself:</em>  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1510\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20181128_162325.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1511\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20181128_123853.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1512\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20181128_150442.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1513\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20181128_125214.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1514\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20181128_115305.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  https://youtu.be/VLiQiWW5yOw  <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0bjAuUu3fzQ&\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <h2><strong>Costs of Doing a Visa Run to Lao Bao by Motorbike</strong></h2> We recommend you driving your own motorbike if you\'re not having a time limit and you\'re flexible with your budget.  Antonio wanted to drive around the province for at least week to explore historical places, but unfortunately, the rain didn\'t stop pouring for a week, so he decided to come back to Da Nang after three days on the road.  <em><strong>Here\'s the breakdown of the cost he had by categories:</strong></em>  <img class=\"wp-image-1490 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.budgdt-lao-bao.jpg\" alt=\"Budget for Lao Bao visa run\" width=\"1487\" height=\"661\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Here\'s the whole breakdown of costs of visa run to Lao Bao and back.</em></div>  As you can see, the who trip costed <strong>roughly 2,920,000 VND</strong>. Antonio was three days on the road and staying two days at the guest house. The province is very cheap when it comes to food (similar prices as the prices in local places around Da Nang), but since the tourism isn\'t a huge economic driver there, the accommodation options are scarce. It means there are hostels which gives you only guest houses as the option.  Guest houses are amazing accommodation, don\'t get us wrong, but it can hit your wallet, especially if you\'re traveling alone!  We\'re always doing comprehensive research when it comes to booking accommodation, so this time, Antonio took the best value room. He chose Hoa Phuong Guest House because of a good price combined with amazing reviews and highest ratings in the city. <h2><b>Final Words</b></h2> Doing a visa run is the reality for the majority of travelers who wants to stay for a bit longer in Vietnam. It’s not the most convenient way to extend your visa, but it is cheap and usually gives you an amazing experience.   We recommend you going to Lao Bao by your own motorbike since you get complete freedom. If you’re lacking the time, motorbike drive isn’t advisable since the<strong> whole round-trip is 550 kilometers long</strong> and it’s almost impossible to finish it in one day.   If you’re lucky and have a few days to do a visa run, then definitely take the bike. The accommodation, food and all other things are relatively cheap in the countryside, the roads combined with stunning views give you an unforgettable experience.   The whole visa process is pretty straightforward since there are many travelers doing a visa run on a daily basis.   Antonio was <strong>3 days on the road</strong> while doing the visa run and spent<strong> around 3 million VND</strong> on the whole visa run (process + logistics).  <hr /> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Please share your visa run experiences with us and don’t hesitate to ask us anything if you have any questions! </strong></em></p>', 'How to Do Visa Run to Lao Bao From Da Nang Like a Boss', 'TODO: Write Excerpt\r\n', 'draft', 'open', 'open', '', '', '', '', '2018-12-28 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', 0, 'http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/?p=12708', 0, 'post', '', 0),

As most people usually start their trips from Saigon or Hanoi, it would be the ideal place to sell your bike. The market in both cities is enormously huge and you won’t have much hustle when finding the buyer for your beloved bike.  <strong><em>The biggest hustle you\'ll have is to get the asked price for your bike!</em></strong> <blockquote> <h3><strong><em>We bought our bikes in Hanoi and sold two of them in Saigon.

Still, there are few more tips that go handy and that can help you a lot!  If you’re following backpackers groups and market, you will notice that the most bikes that are being bought or sold are <strong>Honda Wins or Waves</strong>. There are many fake Honda bikes on the market, but you will instantly see it by different brand name on the engine.   Nevertheless, these bikes are easy to sell.  Other slightly popular bikes among travelers are <strong>SYM and Yamaha</strong>. With these brands, you might have trouble finding the buyer since parts and qualified mechanics are a bit harder to find which means the prices of repairs are bigger. It’s not an attractive fact for budget travelers looking for an adventure of their lifetime.  <blockquote> <h3><strong><em>David had SYM Atilla, a fully automatic motorbike and he managed to sell it for $180 in Saigon. He lost $20 on the sale, but it was a good deal since he had only a few hours before his flight.</em> </strong></h3> </blockquote> Antonio sold his Sufat Win for $110 which was pretty good since he has got the<strong> <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/motorbike-in-vietnam\">bike for free as a gift in Hanoi</a></strong>.   Another tip is to not invest so much money in the motorbike when you’re buying since it will be hard to get the same price. Of course, these bikes will provide you with a better experience on the road, but in the end, you want to sell it for almost the same price you bought it, right?  Lovel bought a <strong>real Honda Wave for $350 in Hanoi</strong> and got so many offers that weren’t higher than $250. To sell these bikes, expect to stay at least three days in the final destination actively looking for the good sale.   Also, when buying a bike from the shops, many of them have a deal to buy your bike back in Saigon or Hanoi. They will usually give you <strong>70 to 80% of the buying price</strong>, but at least you have a sure thing. You can also put it into consideration.  <em><strong>Note:</strong> Shops claim to give you that price on the bike, but we haven\'t tried it, so we don\'t know for sure how reliable it is</em>!  <hr />  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3351\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Phong-Nha-69.jpg\" alt=\"Somewhere in Phong Nha\" width=\"4608\" height=\"3456\" />  So now you have an actionable guide when selling the motorbike in Vietnam. Don’t worry, it won’t be much of the hustle to sell your bike since the demand is huge in both cities.  The usual advice from traveler is to <strong><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam\">buy a bike in Hanoi</a></strong> and sell it in Saigon since the price you will get in Saigon will be better. The opposite is for buying the bike of course.

That’s all!   After some research, I just decided to fly to Vietnam and start <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/starlight-english-center-vietnam\">volunteering as an English teacher</a> in the countryside to get teaching experience. I didn’t have any idea what to expect and I was totally opened and ready for anything. I knew I could handle anything!  My first impression of teaching was me <strong>coming to a small classroom with 20 or more kids inside</strong>. The teacher told me to play games with the kids and I didn’t have any idea what to do. I figured it out and spot and started to play <em>‘Simon says’</em>. Kids enjoyed and the rest is history.   I was concerned about how everything will look like since I didn’t feel comfortable with kids at the beginning, but after a few days of teaching, I started to love the project and the kids.   <strong><em>You’ll have to deal with many things as a teacher in Vietnam:</em></strong> <h3><b>Language Barrier</b></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3380\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.language-barrier.jpg\" alt=\"Language barrier is real in Vietnam\" width=\"962\" height=\"620\" />  The language barrier is real and you will notice it from the first moment of arriving. Even the <strong>teachers can’t talk English fluently</strong> and wait for it - these teachers usually teach in primary and high schools!  You will definitely have a lot of struggle communicating with teacher and kids, but after a while, you will get used to each other and start to understand each other even if there is a barrier in the language.  <em>Just be patient and try your best to explain everything in the simplest way possible!</em> <h3><b>Disorganization in the Schools</b></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3382\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.school-kids.jpg\" alt=\"School kid\" width=\"932\" height=\"615\" />  If you’re used that all stuff should be organized, please don’t expect that in Vietnam. Really, the business in the school is one of the most disorganized things I’ve ever experienced in my life.   It seems like almost no one knows their job and roles and everything is figured out on the spot. I mean, I like how people are flexible and how they can figure out things on the spot, but when you’re teaching, you want everything planned since it doesn’t only affect you, but also the students you’re teaching.  <blockquote><strong><em>I experienced people calling me on my off day, a few minutes before class to come to the school to teach. I didn’t have any prior preparation and I just woke up. It’s going to happen often if you let the management do that.</em></strong></blockquote> <strong><em>Simply say no and explain to them the reasons.</em></strong>  Also, many times there is no organized teaching or lesson plan, so sometimes you’re going to figure out everything on the spot which isn’t the most effective way. Many schools won’t have proper materials which means you need to figure out the materials and ways to deliver the lesson to the students by yourself.   If you can’t live with disorganization, then you will definitely have a lot of struggle adapting to Vietnamese way of doing the business.   And yeah... If the people in Vietnam tell you the starting time of the class or event, <strong>be ready to wait at least 10 minutes since they are very bad at timing and almost always late! </strong> <h3><b>Class Size</b></h3> <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pcX1EitiLOw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  It hugely depends on the type of school you’re teaching in. For instance, I was teaching in private centers where the number of students doesn’t exceed <strong>15 students</strong>. I was also teaching in public schools a few times where the <strong>classes have more than 40 students</strong>.  The technique and <strong>approach to teaching really depend on the classroom size</strong> and it’s very important to know the number of students in the class before preparing for the lesson.   Your voice will have many struggles, even with small classes since Vietnamese students can be very active and noisy from time to time. I don’t need to tell you anything if you’re going to work with the kids - prepare yourself physically and mentally.   You might have a question of controlling such huge classes with a big language barrier. Well, don’t worry, many times you will have a struggle with that, but the good thing is that you will <strong>most likely have a teacher assistant who is Vietnamese and can help you in controlling kids. </strong>  TA’s are of huge help! I had a few classes with 3 years old kids without an assistant and it was impossible to do anything except dancing, singing and making a mess in the classroom.  <h3><b>Cultural Differences</b></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3377\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.culture-difference.jpg\" alt=\"Eating street food\" width=\"1139\" height=\"733\" />  Depending on the place you’re coming from, the <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam\">cultural differences in Vietnam</a> will probably be noticeable, especially in the way the educational system is working.  For instance, Vietnamese schooling system is based on an <strong>outdated teaching method called memorization</strong>. Basically, from the first moment you arrive at school, you will see how the try kids to memorize the words. They will successfully do that and after the class, they will be able to pass the test.  <em>But...What happens a few days after the class?</em> You guess it. The kids don’t have any idea what you were teaching them! <blockquote><em><strong>Memorization really doesn’t work long-term and I had so much struggle with it since I always try to be very creative while teaching. Many Vietnamese teachers and parents didn’t like it, so they ‘forced’ their old school teaching model.</strong> </em></blockquote> Also, <strong>hitting kids is allowed in Vietnam</strong>. I was very shocked when the old teacher hit the kids’ head with a wooden stick. It was pretty hard and loud hit and I was literally shocked. Many foreign teachers shared similar experiences and it’s accepted in Vietnam.   Many Vietnamese teachers started to talk about it and it seems like there is a shift so these topics became sensitive around.  <strong>Further read: </strong><a href=\"https://www.younglives.org.uk/sites/www.younglives.org.uk/files/YL-Vietnam-PP1.pdf\">Learn more about school violence in Vietnam!</a>  When we’re talking about the kids with special needs, they are seen as equal to the other kids, so you will have these kids in the same class with other kids. It’s very pointless since the kids with special needs are being taught at the same pace as other kids and you can notice they don’t get much from the lesson. There should be a specially tailored program for these kids that will enable them to learn by their own pace.   Anyway, teaching in Vietnam is an amazing experience that teaches you so many things, especially how to be patient. There were a lot of downs and negative experiences, but positives outweigh negatives hard time.  <h2><b>Requirements to Become an English Teacher in Vietnam </b></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-3375 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.kristina-last-class.jpg\" alt=\"Teaching in the private English center\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>The entry barrier in teaching is very low, so it\'s relatively easy to become a teacher.

It’s a huge plus if you have a degree in the education field, but not a requirement. Be sure to have a bachelors of any field since getting a work permit requires a degree. It is a great way to filter only the highly educated people from the rest. </li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Clean criminal record</strong>: Before applying for a work permit or any job in Vietnam, you’re required to provide with a clean criminal record from your home country. While it is possible to land a job with a criminal record, it definitely limits your options. </li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Teaching certificate (TEFL/TESOL/CELTA)</strong>: It’s not a requirement, but it gives you so many options. Getting one will teach you how to deal with students and how to successfully deliver the lesson. There are many online courses you can take, but be sure that the course you’re taking is worldwide recognized. Antonio took one from <a href=\"https://internationalopenacademy.com/\">International Open Academy</a> for $20 on a discount. It\'s not recognized worldwide, but he didn\'t have any problems finding a job with that certificate.</li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Teaching experience</strong>: The prior experience will definitely help since many schools require the demo lesson before the interview to see your teaching skills. That’s the point where your previous experience can help! Don’t worry if you don’t have any prior experience since many schools don’t care that much. Also, you can start with a volunteering project first to gather some experience and then you can move to the paid project. </li> </ul> <h2><b>How Hard is to Find a Teaching Job? </b></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-3371 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.44098191_2116427708610260_8395760580836720640_n.jpg\" alt=\"Teaching adults in Da Nang\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Teaching kids is fun but requires a lot of patience. Teaching adults is a totally new level that gives you countless friendships and a great time.</em></div>  I’m sad to say that Vietnam is a <strong>very racist country when it comes to teaching</strong>. If you’re a young white person from a native country without any experience and knowledge about what you’re doing, you’re the perfect candidate.   I met a guy who has a Ph.D., over 5 years of experience in teaching, but he is from India. He couldn’t land a job and barely got a volunteering gig in Vietnam. So many people talk about this issue, so for many, Vietnam is not so attractive because of it.   When I first came to Vietnam, I started to volunteer and I’ve got some experience while teaching kids. Then I started to travel around Vietnam without having a teaching career in the mind. When I was done with the trip I needed to figure out how to get the money that will enable me to stay here for a long time and make some savings on the way.  <strong>Traveling Vietnam: </strong><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget\">Check out the budget breakdown for a motorbike trip in Vietnam!</a>  Teaching market is huge and demand is still bigger than the supply which means getting the job as a non-native speaker is very possible.   I started to apply to many job opportunities around the Facebook groups and got many offers, but didn’t accept any since the majority of the jobs is in Hanoi or Saigon. I wanted to work in Da Nang, but there weren’t many jobs available.   <em><strong>When I’ve come to Da Nang I simply started to drive around with my CV and going to different schools talking with the management. It landed me a few interviews and some teaching hours. </strong></em>  Right now, I’m working for a small center that I found on the Facebook group. There are many job opportunities in Da Nang, but the competition is huge since many centers are <strong>strictly looking for native speakers with qualifications and experience. </strong>  I’m lucky since I have experience and qualification and my English is very fluent. Also, there is one thing that will separate you from other candidates -<strong><em> being passionate to teach!</em></strong>  If you’re looking for jobs in Hanoi or Saigon, then you shouldn’t experience any problems! Simply check out these Facebook groups and connect with the schools that are looking for teachers.  <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> <em>It’s normal to be asked for a free demo lesson and interview afterward.</em> <h2><b>How Much Money Does an English Teacher Make in Vietnam?</b></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-3372 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.getting-paid-in-vietnam.jpg\" alt=\"Getting paid in Vietnam\" width=\"1148\" height=\"775\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Teacher\'s salaries are very good compared to Vietnamese average salary.

From my experience, the usual<strong> hourly rate starts at $15 and can even go up to $30.</strong> We’re talking about the rate after tax!   Usually, you’ll get the probation period for the first month and the salary will be a bit lower, but once you get the contract, you can expect a higher salary.  <strong>More information: </strong><a href=\"https://travelingteacher.net/\">How to become a certified English teacher in Vietnam!</a>  The most usual way how schools pay the teachers are by the bank accounts. Once you get a work permit, you’re able to open a Vietnamese bank account where the schools deposit your salary.   Many job opportunities<strong> offer 80 - 100 teaching hours per month and free accommodation</strong>. You do the math how much money you can earn and save per month.  <h2><b>Types of English Schools in Vietnam</b></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-3374 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.494185263_801759696a_b.jpg\" alt=\"Kids going from the school\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>There are few types of schools, but most likely, you\'re going to teach in privately owned English center.</em></div>  <em>Every school type will provide you with the different overall experience. English teachers usually teach at:</em> <ul>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Language centers</strong>: In the last few years, English centers started to pop up like mushrooms after the rain. In the big cities, it’s not unusual to see a few centers in the same street, even next to each other. Many of these centers are filled with kids from primary and secondary school. I’m teaching at private English centers and usually, you’ll get 20 hours per week in the afternoon hours; when kids finish with their classes at school. I prefer language centers since the classes are smaller, you have a teacher assistant and there is some existent organization. Not to forget, the length of the classes is usually 1.5 hours. </li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Public schools</strong>: I was teaching a few times in public schools since the kids from the center are mainly from public schools and centers have cooperation with these schools. The classroom is bigger and you’ll usually need to handle about 30 students. The pay is better and the classes are up to 30 minutes. </li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>International schools</strong>: If you’re a very qualified teacher, then this type of schools is the way to go! These are schools that follow a specially created curriculum. For instance, some schools follow the same curriculum as in England, so these are providing more benefits for the people enrolling to the classes. The payment is very attractive, but it requires a lot of experience in planning and delivering the lessons. Also, you have to be a native English speaker to land a job in these. </li> </ul> <h2><b>What About Visa and Work Permit for Teaching Legally?</b></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-3373\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.2502642043_56a7df25f3_b.jpg\" alt=\"Visa and work permit for Vietnam\" width=\"806\" height=\"604\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Be sure to have all proper documentation sorted out before starting out your new teaching job.</em></div>  Unfortunately, you’ll need to do a <strong>quite lot of documentation in order to become a legal English teacher in Vietnam</strong>. There are many cases where teachers are working on tourist or business visas, but please note it’s illegal and you can get deported from the country if you get caught.   The immigration officers sometimes pop up at centers or schools to check out the situation and there are many stories of teachers who got deported because working on a wrong visa or without proper documents.   Many schools will tell you it’s fine to teach without the contract or on a tourist visa, but don’t believe that! If you don’t have a contract and work permit with a school, then you’re technically an illegal teacher who is risking a deport stamp in your passport.   Be smart and find a school that will support you in the process of obtaining a work permit.   Getting a work permit can be a costly and long process, but it’s necessary if you want to stay for a long time in Vietnam. The schools will usually give you a probation month or two while helping you with getting a work permit, so you can earn money and work while waiting for the permit to be processed.   <em><strong>There are many documents you need to obtain in order to get a work permit:</strong></em> <ul>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working contract from your school</li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A legalized copy of your degree</li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A legalized copy of your teaching certificate</li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A criminal background check from your home country</li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A health check is done in a Vietnamese hospital</li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A scan of your passport and valid visa</li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4 passport sized photos</li>          <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business visa sponsored by your school</li> </ul> Once you have all the documents in your pocket, you’re ready for the process of getting a work permit.   <strong>Legalities: </strong><a href=\"https://www.studycelta.com/blog/advice-and-tips/get-work-permit-teach-english-vietnam/\">Getting a work permit in Vietnam!</a>  <em>Congratulations! After getting your work permit, you officially became an English teacher in Vietnam!</em>  <hr />  <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Frequently Asked Questions </b></h2> We did research on the topic and come up with the answers to the most common questions people ask when thinking about coming to Vietnam to teach English. We already answered many questions through the article, but this is a huge step for many people, so it’s never enough information. <h3><em><b>How much teachers can make in Vietnam?</b></em></h3> The usual <strong>hourly rates start at $15 and can reach up to $30</strong>. It hugely depends on the type of the school and the location. For instance, I am currently living and teaching in Da Nang where the costs are bit lower and the competition is huge, so the average hourly rate is around $18. Expect to work around <strong>80 hours for a full-time position and 50 for half-time</strong>.   Many schools will provide their teachers with free accommodation, which means you’ll save much money for your future travels.  <h3><em><b>Do you need a degree to teach in Vietnam?</b></em></h3> Shortly, yes! You need at least a bachelor’s degree to legally teach in Vietnam. Many people don’t have any degree and they teach, but most likely on the wrong visa which makes them vulnerable from immigration. In order to get a work permit in Vietnam, you must have at least a bachelor’s diploma.  <h3><b><em>Can you teach without a teaching certificate?</em> </b></h3> Yes, but it limits your opportunities. Many schools will require you to get a teaching certificate before starting, but also, they will accept candidates without one. Every school will require you to take a course once you start working with them if you already don’t have one.   There are many places where you can obtain a teaching certificate. Sometimes it’s very confusing, so we advise you to always <strong>get an internationally recognized certificate</strong>.  <h3><em><b>What are the best cities to work in Vietnam?</b></em></h3> Definitely major cities in Vietnam - Saigon, Da Nang, Hanoi. There are many job opportunities and different school types. For experienced and qualified teachers there are many amazing positions in the huge cities. Also, the quality of life is not comparable to smaller cities. The salaries are more attractive, but also the cost of living is higher, so it’s up to you to make the decision.   For non-natives, it’s easier to get a job in smaller cities or countryside since the competition is very weak or even non-existent. The biggest downside of smaller cities is not enough things to do. I was living in the countryside and teaching for 4 months and after a few months the project became very boring and everything seemed like a routine, so I needed to move on. <h3><em><b>Where to find job opportunities?</b></em></h3> The best and easiest way to find your next teaching project is by checking the major Facebook groups.   <strong><em>Here are some groups:</em></strong> <ul>          <li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/224249958335462/\">Teaching jobs in Da Nang</a></li>          <li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/916145635087307/\">Teaching jobs in Vietnam</a></li>          <li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1517310348497729/\">Hanoi English teaching jobs</a></li>          <li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/123103348331362/\">Teaching jobs in Saigon</a></li> </ul> Simply put a few pictures of yourself teaching, write a bit about yourself and post it to the groups. Soon, you will get many requests and contacts from school owners or recruiters.   <em><strong>Have prepared CV, passport scan and teaching certificate (optional).</strong> </em> <h3><em><b>How to get teaching experience before applying for a teaching position?</b></em></h3> The best advice I can give you when it comes to getting experience as an English teacher is by volunteering first. I started to volunteer as a teacher in the countryside to get the feeling of teaching. I didn’t have any idea how it will look like, but I was very curious about it and also it was a huge challenge to me. I gave it a try!  After a while, I started to really enjoy teaching kids and I decided I can take a job and teach for a while in Vietnam.  <h3><em><b>How hard is for a non-native speaker to get a teaching job?</b></em></h3> It really depends on many factors. As we already mentioned, Vietnam is a bit racists country, but when it comes to teaching then you will really experience racism.   I met many non-natives with an almost native level of teaching getting struggle with finding their job as they were from Asia, specifically from the Philippines or Singapore. After observing and talking with many teachers, I would say that if you’re a good-looking white person with a fluent level of English, you can score a job in Vietnam. It will be a bit tougher in major cities since the competition is huge and there are many native speakers, but you can give it a try! In smaller cities or countryside you can definitely score a good job!  <hr />  <h2><b>Final Words</b></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-3376 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC07027.jpg\" alt=\"Teaching in outdoor class is lot of fun!\" width=\"3344\" height=\"2224\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Teaching English in Vietnam is an amazing experience where you\'ll learn so much from the people and students.

There are not many requirements to score your new English teaching job, but there are definitely many tricky situations and scams on the market. Always be careful when thinking about getting the new teaching job and don\'t agree on working without a work permit as a teacher!

Usually, people get a tourist visa and the information in this article is mainly focused on a tourist visa.   What if you plan to work in Vietnam? You definitely need to <strong>grant a business visa and obtain a work permit</strong>.  For travelers who’re traveling to another country through Vietnam, the best way to spend some quality time in the country is by getting a transit visa.   <em>We’re going to cover all types of visa you can get and the options to extend your time in the country if you really like your time here!</em> <h2><b>A Few Things About Vietnam Tourist Visa</b></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3527\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.croatian-passport.jpg\" alt=\"Croatian passport\" width=\"708\" height=\"528\" />  <em>A tourist visa is the most issued visa in Vietnam and the numbers of visa issued are climbing up on a fast pace!</em>  The process of getting a tourist visa is very straightforward, fast and it won’t cost you a fortune.   Before we dig into the details, we should mention lucky countries that are eligible for a visa exemption. By the laws, upon arriving all the visitors must provide a valid passport, proper invitation letter and the flight ticket (<strong>you can travel to Vietnam with a one-way ticket</strong>).  Anyway, some countries have a mutual agreement with the Vietnamese government when it comes to visa exemption. Precisely, the passport holders from <strong>22 countries around the world can enter Vietnam without an invitation letter for a visa</strong>.  <hr />  <em>If you’re holding one of these passports, you will be able to visit Vietnam for <strong>15 - 90 days without a visa:</strong></em>  <strong>14 days:</strong> Brunei, Myanmar  <strong>15 days:</strong>  UK, Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Russia, Belarus, Japan, South Korea  <strong>21 days:</strong> Philippines  <strong>30 days:</strong> Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Laos  <strong>90 days:</strong> Chile  <hr />  <em>What’s the process if you’re a passport holder from the countries on the list, but you decide to stay longer than 15 days?</em>  Well, there are a few possible options that will cost you money and time.  The first option is visa renewal that can be done in the main Immigration Department in Hanoi, Da Nang, and Saigon. The best way is to go on their official website and check the process for doing a visa renewal.  Always be sure that you check the <a href=\"https://www.myvietnamvisa.com/vietnam-visa-exemption.html\"><strong>updated information on visa exemptions</strong></a> since you don\'t want to get to the immigration and find out you need a visa for Vietnam.  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> If you’re traveling to Vietnam without the visa, you can’t do a visa extension.</div>  If you want to avoid the huge costs of visa renewal, the best option would be to grant an invitation letter for a Vietnam visa that can be easily obtained <strong>through many agencies for $25 (3-month single-entry visa)</strong>.   With that option, you can save yourself a lot of time and money, even if you won’t stay in Vietnam for that long.  <h2><b>So What’s the Process for Travelers Who’re Not in the List Above?</b></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3531\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.vietnam-flag.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnam flag in Hue\" width=\"1009\" height=\"751\" />  If you’re not born under the lucky star and you’re not a passport holder from the countries above, don’t worry, as getting and staying in Vietnam is relatively easy to process.   You can get your approval letter from the Vietnamese embassy in your country or simply by arranging a travel agency that is specialized for visa-on-arrival.   The main options for a tourist visa are a <strong>1-month and 3-month visa</strong> that can be a single or multiple entries. If you’re not sure about your traveling plans and you might get out of the country before the stamped date, then investing a little bit more money to get a multiple-entry visa is what you should think about!  <em>Once you’ve figured out the type of visa you’d like to get, then it’s time to get your hands on the invitation letter.</em> <h3><b>a) Going to a Vietnamese Embassy in Your Country</b></h3> Going to the embassy is a great option, but it takes a lot of time, especially when you compare it with the online visa application. If you decide to go that way, then you need to book an appointment to the Vietnamese embassy in your country and bring a passport and two passport-sized pictures.   You will get a form which you fill with your information and that’s it. In a few days, your letter will be in your post and email. It usually takes up to a week to get a letter that way. <h3><b>b) Applying Through Online Travel Agencies</b></h3> We prefer this option since you really don’t spend much time doing it. You need a picture of your passport and personal pictures. There is an online form where you fill in your details and after 2 days you get the invitation letter that you just need to print out and show to the immigration officer at the airport.  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> We’re Croatians, so we can write through our perspective, but keep in mind that process and requirement may vary depending on your passport.

You don’t need to go anywhere, and you just need to apply online with your information. After a few working days (depending on the company) your invitation letter is ready and you can fly to Vietnam.  Visa on arrival is the type of document that enables a holder to get a visa issued. Every letter needs to be approved by Vietnam Immigration Office. Once it’s approved, you get the stamp on the letter and show it to the immigration officer at the airport and you will get a visa sticker for days that are stated in the letter.   <em>Easy, right?</em>  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> If you’re getting to the country by plane, be sure that you’re arriving at the international airport as you can only get a visa issued on these.

You will get all the information needed to obtain the invitation letter. Another option is to find a reliable travel agency that can provide you with an invitation letter. It’s usually a faster process, but it a bit more costly as these agencies work on a commission basis. </li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fill the form with the information. You will need your passport and personal photos of you. </li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You pay for issuing the letter. It usually <strong>costs around $25 (three-month single-entry tourist visa)</strong>, but it depends on the type of your visa.</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the processing period is done, you will get an invitation letter on your email with the further information. You need to print out the letter and bring it out with you. When you arrive at a department airport, you need to show the letter on the check-in counter or otherwise, they won’t let you through. </li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you land to Vietnam, go to \'<em>visa on arrival\'</em> counter and prepare your letter, passport, pictures, and cash for a visa sticker fee. A fee for a <strong>single-entry visa is $25 and $50 for a multiple-entry</strong>. </li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you get a visa sticker and a stamp, please check out the dates to be sure that everything is fine. If everything is fine, then head over to passport control.</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Holla! You’re officially in Vietnam! Don’t forget to pick up your luggage.</li> </ol> Getting a visa on arrival is the most popular option for tourists getting in the country because it’s very fast, safe and it won’t hit your wallet so hard.   <em><strong>But wait, it’s not the end of the options when it comes to getting visa!</strong></em> <h2><b>E-Visa</b></h2> Electronic visa became popular in recent years and many countries implemented that process to get into the country for 30 days.   In Vietnam, passport holders from some countries can get an e-visa that is basically an electronic document checked and signed by the Vietnamese government and it allows travelers to <strong>stay up to 30 days</strong>.   The only problem is that if you decide to stay longer in the country, you need to do a visa renewal which is very costly and in the end, it will cost you much more money than getting a visa on arrival.   Here, you can check out countries that are <a href=\"https://www.vietnamonlinevisas.com/\"><strong>eligible for getting an e-visa for Vietnam</strong></a>. <h2><b>I Want to Stay Longer in Vietnam! What Are the Options?</b></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3529\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.experience-vietnam.jpg\" alt=\"Stunning Phong Nha National Park\" width=\"1339\" height=\"716\" />  Many travelers want to extend their stay in Vietnam after having a stunning experience in the country. It happened to us a few times already!   At first, I came to Vietnam with a business visa for three months and then I did a visa run twice. My brother overstayed for a few days in Vietnam (we will talk about it too and what’s the process and cost of overstaying in the country).   <strong><em>There are three different options when it comes to extending your stay in Vietnam:</em></strong> <ol>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visa extension</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visa renewal</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visa run</li> </ol> We’re going to provide you with the information on each option, so it’s up to you to choose the most suitable one for you and your current situation.  <h2><b>Visa Extension</b></h2> Visa extension is the way to prolong your stay in Vietnam without leaving the country. It’s never cheap to do it without leaving a country, so this option can be very expensive. Basically, visa extension means that the Vietnamese government grants you more time in the country.   You can do visa extension in three main immigration offices around Vietnam including Hanoi, Da Nang, and Saigon. The process itself isn’t so complicated as you only need to go to the immigration and fill the forms with basic information. You can extend your visa by another one or three months, depending on your current visa type.  <strong>More details: <a href=\"https://www.myvietnamvisa.com/vietnam-visa-extension.html#hmf\">Learn everything about doing visa renewal and extension!</a></strong>  For instance, if you’d like to extend your visa for another month, then you need to have at least a one-month visa in your passport. The price for doing that<strong> varies from $50 - $160</strong>, depending on your nationality.   If you’re planning to extend for another three months, then you need to have a three-month visa in your passport. It costs <strong>from $170 - $320</strong>, again depending on your nationality.  <h2><b>Visa Renewal</b></h2> Another option for travelers who entered the country on the visa exemption is doing a visa renewal. By doing it, you’ll get a new sticker and a stamp and the whole process is very similar to visa extension, but a bit more costly.   You can renew your visa for the maximum three months and also, you can upgrade your current visa from 1 to 3 months and from single to multiple entries.   <em><strong>The cost is fixed and it will cost you $200 for 1-month single entry, $330 for 3 months single and $350 for 3 months multiple entries. </strong></em>  The whole process is going through the Vietnam Immigration Office in major cities.  <h2><b>Visa Run</b></h2> The most popular option when it comes to extending your stay in Vietnam is by far a <em>‘visa run’</em>. Some nationalities can’t do a visa renewal or extension, so they are forced to leave the country and obtain a new valid visa to prolong their stay.   This process is the cheapest one and it allows you to get a new visa for up to three months. Many travelers who decided to stay in Vietnam for a long time usually do visa runs every three months.   The process is very similar to getting the visa on arrival. You need to apply for getting an invitation letter through a travel agency or immigration office. Once you get the invitation letter, you must go to the international border (if you’re traveling by land) in Laos or Cambodia. You need to have a valid passport, letter and photos to obtain the new visa. Here\'s everything you have to know about the <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/visa-run-vietnam\"><strong>Vietnam visa run</strong></a> process, so prepare yourself and stay longer in Vietnam without problems.  Doing a visa run from Da Nang? Check out all details to do a <strong><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/visa-run-lao-bao\">visa run from Da Nang to popular international border called Lao Bao</a>.</strong> The route is scenic and historic since Quang Tri suffered a lot during the war.  The whole process is pretty straightforward and it won’t take you more than an hour. Just be sure that you have all the documents checked as you don’t want to overstay in Vietnam.   Also, you can travel by plane to another country, spend some time there and return to Vietnam. That’s a bit more costly, but it’s still cheaper than doing a renewal or extension.  <h2><b>Transit Visa</b></h2> Travelers who’re just passing through Vietnam to reach their final destination don’t need a transit visa. It’s a very convenient way to explore country during your layover as there is almost not any documentation needed to get a transit visa.  The only problem with Vietnamese transit visa is that you can’t leave airport, but you can pass a passport control in case you want to sleep at the airport. It’s not the most comfortable place to sleep, so booking a hostel or hotel would make much more sense.  <strong>More information: <a href=\"http://www.vietnamvisa-easy.com/vietnam-visa-requirements/requirements-for-vietnam-transit-visa\">Learn all details when it comes to transit visa!</a></strong>  The best way to organize your layover in Vietnam is to make a tourist visa for a month and just get out of airport to explore the city you’re in.   If you don’t have time or energy to do it and you want to get a transit visa, the process is very straightforward. You need to present the immigration with the valid passport, a flight ticket to the third country and a valid visa for the destination country. That’s all the hustle you need to go through!  <h2><b>Avoiding a Visa Hustle and Travel Without a Visa in Vietnam</b></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3532\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.phu-quoc.jpg\" alt=\"Phu Quoc Island\" width=\"910\" height=\"624\" />  Some people are luckier than others when it comes to visa exemption so they can travel to Vietnam for a certain amount of time without a visa.   If you’re planning to visit Vietnam just to have a perfect vacation and relax a bit, then there is one option where you can get to Vietnam without acquiring a visa.   Phu Quoc is the island in Vietnam territory that is classified as a ‘special economic zone’ which means <strong>all travelers get a visa exemption for 30 days while traveling to this exotic island</strong>.   <em>Getting a visa exemption is a relatively easy process, but you must be sure to meet the following criteria when applying for the exemption:</em> <ul>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to have a valid passport that is not expiring in the next 6 months</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must have a round trip flight ticket with the final destination that is not Vietnam</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can only stay in Phu Quoc for 30 days</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don’t have deportation stamp on your passport or any offenses in Vietnam</li>   <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must not be on the Interpol list</li> </ul> Believe us or not, that is all you need to get a visa exemption!  Be sure that you have all the documents and that you’re passing all the criteria before visiting the island. Also, please do the further research about visa exemption to Phu Quoc by visiting </span><strong><a href=\"https://www.phuquocislandguide.com/phu-quoc-visa/https://www.phuquocislandguide.com/phu-quoc-visa/\">this site</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  <hr />  Now you have all the information when it comes to applying for a tourist visa in Vietnam.

Please check the latest updates and policies before visiting the country, since the visa requirements change all the time for some country.   <em><strong>The best way to be sure is to</strong></em> <em><strong>call the Vietnamese embassy in your country before applying for any visa to make sure you have all the documents needed for Vietnamese visa. </strong></em>  Wish you a safe trip filled with amazing experiences!

One of the most important aspects when hitting the road is thinking where are you going to stay. It’s possible to set up your camping site almost anywhere (the permit is required for certain places), but for travelers who’re looking for a basic level of comfort, booking a room or a bed is more convenient. </span>  <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'><em>When it comes to booking the accommodation, there are few reliable apps that work like charm in Vietnam (and everywhere else).</em> </span>  <hr />  <h2><b>#1 Booking.com</b></h2> <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'>You probably already heard for Booking.com even if you\'ve just started with traveling. This app covers almost every country in the world (<strong>228 countries and territories</strong>) and it’s very intuitive to use. All you need is set up a profile (you can connect your Facebook account too) and fill the basic information about the preferred accommodation in the search like date, number of travelers and place. </span>  <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'>That’s it!</span>  <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'>There is a very good filter option that can help you in filtering the accommodation by your preferences. Not to forget, the community is amazing and people usually leave the reviews, so don’t forget to read some before booking your stay through the platform. </span>  <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'>Booking.com has an interesting program for the trusted members and you can get good discounts on your account after booking a few stays. It’s called a Genius program and it’s very genius when you realize you get <strong>10 - 20% of discount</strong> on selected accommodation. </span>  <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'>Another amazing thing about Booking is that for the majority of options, you don’t have to do a prepayment, instead pay on the site! It’s amazing for people who don’t like the accommodation once they come and see it by themselves. </span>  <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'>Go ahead, install the app, create a profile and pick among the best accommodation options in Vietnam!</span>  <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'><strong>Platforms:</strong> iOs and Android</span>  <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'><strong>Price:</strong> Free</span> <div class=\'btn-container\'><a class=\'link-btn\' href=\'https://www.booking.com/apps.html\'> <div class=\'text-button\'>Click here to download the app!</div></a></div>   <hr />  <h2><b>#2 Agoda</b></h2> <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'>Basically, the same platform as Booking.com, but when it comes to scoring the cheapest deals, nothing can compare to Agoda. The listings at Booking and Agoda are almost the same, but the huge difference plays when it comes to price. </span>  <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'>Agoda usually gives their users best deals and discounts when it comes to accommodation options. For example, the hostel is almost fully- booked, but there are still a few beds available and the company wants them all booked. They usually put their listings at Agoda and provide travelers with cheaper price than on other platforms; so-called last minute deals. </span>  <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'>Many times, we stumbled on the same accommodation option, but totally different price. If you’re traveling on a strict budget, it won’t hurt to have Agoda installed just for a backup when checking the prices of stays!</span>  <strong>Platforms: </strong>iOs and Android  <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'><strong>Price:</strong> Free</span> <div class=\'btn-container\'><a class=\'link-btn\' href=\'https://www.agoda.com/appdownload\'> <div class=\'text-button\'>Click here to download the app!</div></a></div>   <hr />  <h2><b>#3 Airbnb</b></h2> <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'>Airbnb is another very commonly used platform among travelers who’re looking for more comfort and also ready to pay for it.

You just create a profile and connect the app with your phone number so drivers can reach you out. </span>  <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'>The app provides you with the map and different options around you. It’s very amazing how flexible Grab is since the app for Vietnam has the option of GrabAbike - you just call the motorbike taxi which is perfect for solo travelers. </span>  <em><span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'><strong>There are many other options including a car for two, four, and up to 9 people.</strong> </span></em>  <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'>You set up your destination and depending on your driving option, you’ll get an exact price before even getting to the car.

Using the app gives you the option to plan your timing, the budget and much more when it comes to flying around the country and abroad. </span>  <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'>Our tip is to always get the information about the flight on Skyscanner, but don’t forget to <strong>check the official flight company when booking the flight, since we had the experience that prices usually differ in the advantage of official flight companies</strong>.</span>  <strong>Platforms: </strong>iOs and Android  <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'><strong>Price:</strong> Free</span> <div class=\'btn-container\'><a class=\'link-btn\' href=\'https://www.skyscanner.com/mobile.html\'> <div class=\'text-button\'>Click here to download the app!</div></a></div>   <hr />  <h2><b>#6 BusMap</b></h2> <strong><em>Did you know that Saigon has more than 100 official bus lines that stop to about 2,000 places around the city?</em> </strong>  <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'>Navigating and figuring out the bus lines can be a real hustle in a busy Saigon.

When coming to the new country, there is one thing you can’t live without - a map. There are countless mobile apps that help you in navigating around the new places, and we included few that have interesting features.</span>  <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'>Don’t have internet access, don’t worry since the map apps provide you with the offline maps and navigation that can definitely go handy, especially when traveling around remote areas.</span>  <hr />  <h2><b>#12 Maps.me</b></h2> <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'>The first map app that comes to a mind is definitely Maps.me. This app is incredibly easy to use and intuitive and it’s a proper competitor to Google Maps. We used this app on our trip more often than Google Maps since you can use it offline and you can also download maps from other travelers with marked locations which gave us the information about off-the-beaten-path in some locations. </span>  <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'>There is also a GPS and much more roads than in Google Maps since the community updates the map continually which means you can even see the hiking trails and small paved roads on the maps.</span>  <strong>Platform: </strong>iOs and Android  <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'><strong>Price:</strong> Free </span> <div class=\'btn-container\'><a class=\'link-btn\' href=\'https://maps.me/download/\'> <div class=\'text-button\'>Click here to download the app!</div></a></div>   <hr />  <h2><b>#13 Google Maps</b></h2> <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'>Good old Google Maps! We think there is not much to add when it comes to this app and probably every traveler used this app once during the travels! It can work offline too, but you can download the maps of the area first. We used this app occasionally around Vietnam, but we prefer Maps.Me. It’s very reliable to use this app when you’re driving between the cities or places, but once you’re navigating around the big cities, the app can be a real hell. </span>  <span style=\'font-weight: 400;\'>When trying to find specific places around the cities, the app will sometimes navigate you to a completely different part of the town.

When we were coming to Vietnam, we did a lot of research about the culture, traditions, routes, delicious food and places to see, but also, we didn’t forget to do huge research on getting and smoking cannabis in Vietnam.  We traveled around Vietnam with motorbikes, and <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget\"><strong>you can check how much money we spent</strong></a> during the whole trip. In the report, you will notice that <strong>a huge piece of our budget went to getting cannabis.</strong>  Vietnam is definitely <strong>a weed-friendly country</strong> (from our experience) and getting your hands on some cannabis is literally effortless. The quality isn’t the best, but it’s going to get you a high for sure!  In this article, we’re going to provide you with information about the laws, places to get cannabis, weed quality, our experiences and generally all the stuff you have to know about cannabis in Vietnam!  <em><strong>Don’t worry; you’re going to satisfy the weed addict in Vietnam!</strong></em> <h2><strong>Cannabis Laws are Pretty Strict on the Paper but in Practice...</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-3976 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.cannabis-laws-vietnam-e1549297785160.jpg\" alt=\"Cannabis laws in Vietnam are very strict on paper, but the implementation is not!\" width=\"500\" height=\"295\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Cannabis laws in Vietnam are very strict on paper, but the implementation is not!</div>  Once we started to do research about cannabis in Vietnam, we directly jumped to cannabis laws, and we were pretty shocked! They still have a death sentence, and <strong>you can get executed by using or distributing drugs</strong>; cannabis included!  The laws are mainly referring to imprisonment; if you’re lucky, but also, for selling or distributing, the penalties can lead you in front of shooting squad.  We were pretty shocked at first, and we said, alright, <strong>no cannabis for us!</strong>  After an initial thought, we decided <strong>to find a way to get and smoke around the country</strong> and do most detailed research ever!  Later, after talking with many locals, expats, tourists and reading many stories on different forums, we concluded that the <strong>laws aren’t enforced by the police officers when it comes to cannabis; especially if a foreigner consumes it.</strong>  Vietnam wants to become a huge tourist destination and police doesn’t want to bother foreigners for smoking a joint since it can possibly make a country less attractive for young travelers.  It has its benefits, but also many disadvantages.  For instance, in major cities where there is a huge expat community, <strong>you can walk around the street and smell cannabis on each step.</strong> That’s cool at first sight, but when you think a bit about local people living there, it’s probably not the best thing ever!  We saw many people openly walking around the city while smoking a huge spliff without caring about anything or anyone.  It’s generally OK to smoke, but always <strong>use your common sense while doing anything illegal</strong> in a foreign country. Especially in Vietnam since the cops are very corrupt, so if they want, they will get a considerable bribe from you.  Don’t be the guy who is smoking in the middle of the street during the day. It’s stupid and not respectful to local people.  <em><strong>Always smoke in secluded places, or nature, or bars where the owners are OK with smoking cannabis inside.</strong></em>  No matter what, don’t grow or sell cannabis. Even if you’re a tourist, you will end up in huge trouble and possibly in life imprisonment. Also, don’t think about smuggling cannabis from the other country to Vietnam. There are a lot of <strong>places where you can score good quality cannabis</strong> around the country, so don’t worry that you won’t find any. <h2><strong>How Hard is to Get Your Hands on Cannabis in Vietnam?</strong></h2> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-3987\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.high-times-hanoi-2.jpg\" alt=\"Check around the expat community in Vietnam; you\'ll probably find some weed and make friends!\" width=\"1605\" height=\"903\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Check around the expat community in Vietnam; you\'ll probably find some weed and make friends!</em></div>  It really depends on the place where you are currently staying at, but generally, it’s straightforward to get some. The biggest concern is the quality and quantity! Don’t worry about it for now; we’re going to talk about it soon.  From our experience, it’s very easy to get a good quality weed in the places where there is an <strong>expat community.</strong> In touristic areas, it’s relatively easy to get cannabis, but the quality is questionable.  <div data-gyg-href=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/default/activites.frame\" data-gyg-locale-code=\"en-US\" data-gyg-widget=\"activities\" data-gyg-number-of-items=\"3\" data-gyg-currency=\"USD\" data-gyg-partner-id=\"781AB6P\" data-gyg-q=\"Vietnam\"></div><script async defer src=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js\"></script>  Traveling to Hanoi? <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/weed-in-hanoi\">Read about things you should know about weed in the capital!</a>  If you’re planning to travel around the country for a certain time, we advise you to <strong>get enough in Saigon, Da Nang, and Hanoi.</strong> In these three cities, the expat community is huge, so you can connect with fellow expats who will introduce you to the cannabis scene.  Inside the other touristic cities, there will be some places to get cannabis, but mainly <strong>taxi drivers will approach you to sell you some.</strong> It’s up to you if you’d like to get it since <strong>many of them are scammers</strong> and sometimes, they can even work with the police, so we suggest you - skip it.  So, to answer your question - <strong>getting cannabis around Vietnam is literally effortless!</strong> With a bit of research, you can get all the information!  <strong><em>Don’t forget to check expat Facebook groups!</em></strong> Here are some of them: <p id=\"seo_h1_tag\" class=\"_19s-\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1495366197398165/\"><strong>Expats &amp; Locals In Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon)</strong></a></p> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/461986580648568/\"><strong>VIETNAM BACKPACKER TRAVEL AND TIPS</strong></a>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/ExpatVietnam/\"><strong>Expats &amp; Locals in Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City) - Vietnam</strong></a>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1920806298166285/\"><strong>DANANG &amp; HOI AN FOREIGN EXPATS</strong></a>  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/hanoiexpat/\"><strong>Hanoi Expats</strong></a> <h2><strong>Alright, but How About the Prices?</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-3978 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.weed-price-vietnam.jpg\" alt=\"Weed price in Vietnam is very low compared to the Western standards.\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Weed price in Vietnam is very low compared to the Western standards.</em></div>  Compared to western prices, the cannabis basically costs nothing in Vietnam. The average price for <strong>a bag of 5 grams is 250k VND</strong> which is just a bit more than $10.  Although the quality isn’t the best, you will definitely feel a decent high.  The baggie of 5 grams usually lasted us for 3 - 5 days, depending on our travels. For instance, if we were staying in one place for longer, then the baggie would burn like crazy. If we were traveling on the motorbikes between the cities, then we wouldn’t smoke so much as we avoided to smoke on the road as much as possible.  There are options to get high-quality indoor grown strains, but prepare your wallet as <strong>the prices are usually around 500k VND for a single gram.</strong> It’s even more expensive than in Europe for the questionable quality.  These prices and quantities are from expat bars and areas, but there is also an <strong>option to buy on the street from motorbike dealers.</strong> As we already mentioned, we don’t advise you to do it as there are many scams related. More on that later.  The prices on the street are usually <strong>900k VND for a baggie of claimed 5 grams.</strong> Sometimes, it’s not even cannabis inside the bag, and undoubtedly you won’t get the claimed quantity. You can always bargain the price, but don’t expect the price to go down so much. If there is not another option for you, and you really want to smoke, then try your best to bargain and <strong>learn basic Vietnamese phrases when it comes to numbers.</strong> <h2><strong>What About the Cannabis Quality in Vietnam?</strong></h2> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-3982\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.cannabis-quality.jpg\" alt=\"Although the cannabis quality in Vietnam isn\'t the best; the cost/benefit ratio is pretty high!\" width=\"4320\" height=\"3240\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Although the cannabis quality in Vietnam isn\'t the best; the cost/benefit ratio is pretty high!</em></div>  Well, <strong>the quality isn’t the best in the world</strong>, but when you put the price in the consideration, then you get a fair quality cannabis for pennies. <strong>Every joint will make you mildly high</strong> which is perfect, especially if you’re up for cruising with the motorbike through the highway like that.  We usually stumbled upon three different types of weed in Vietnam:  <strong>Vietnam outdoor grown</strong>  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3981\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.vietnamese-weed.jpg\" alt=\"The Vietnamese weed is the cheapest you can get there, but also, expect a lot of stems and seeds inside the pack!\" width=\"958\" height=\"571\" />  It’s the lowest quality and the cheapest. It’s working, but you need to put a lot in one joint. Also, sometimes, we experienced headaches from this one. The baggie will be full with stems and seeds, so you will need to throw much from it.  <strong>Cambodian/Laotian import</strong>  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3979\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.cambodian-weed.jpg\" alt=\"Cambodian weed import is the best one in Vietnam when talking about cost/benefit ratio.\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" />  This is the best offer you can get in Vietnam. The price is very reasonable, and the quality is very good for Vietnam standards. We recommend you go for this option.  <strong>Canadian import/indoor grown</strong>  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3980\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.canadian-import.jpg\" alt=\"The Canadian import is mostly grown inside, and is very expensive.\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" />  The most expensive one which is even more costly than European cannabis. If you want to spoil yourself, you can spend your money elsewhere or on other things. We don’t recommend smoking this type since Cambodian will give you the same effects.  It’s up to you to choose the right type for you! We were mainly smoking Vietnamese schwag and Cambodian imports along the road. Sometimes, from Vietnamese weed we experienced a slight headache, but except from that, everything was fine. Both types can work very well and give you nice experiences! <h2><strong>What Are the Common Scams When It Comes to Cannabis?</strong></h2> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-3989\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.motorbike-taxi.jpg\" alt=\"Most of the weed-related scams in Vietnam are related to motorbike taxi drivers.\" width=\"854\" height=\"583\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Most of the weed-related scams in Vietnam are related to motorbike taxi drivers.</em></div>  From our experience, <strong>we only fell under one scam</strong>, and it was in Phan Thiet. We bought some cannabis from a motorbike driver as we didn’t have any cannabis left. The quantity was definitely not what he was saying it is, and it was probably the worst weed we’ve ever smoked!  <em>When your cannabis addict is desperate, you don’t ask, right?</em>  The other scams from the stories of people are usually related to <strong>taxi and motorbike drivers.</strong> They will sell you cannabis and then report you to the police. Afterwards, they will follow you back to your accommodation and bust you. After the bust, the police officer will ask you for a bribe, and then <strong>the seller and police are sharing the money.</strong>  These two scams are usually the most common when it comes to cannabis in Vietnam.  Our advice is: <strong>never buy cannabis from street dealers!</strong> You will probably never experience a scam that way.  If you really can’t avoid buying on the street, then, always <strong>ask to smell the bag and check the quality.</strong> Many street dealers won’t give you to do that, and then you can just walk away as it is probably a scam.  <em><strong>Never forget to bargain!</strong></em>  Don’t want to get scammed in Vietnam?

When we all met in Hanoi, probably an hour after David’s and Lovel’s landing, we’ve found an interesting pub where <strong>you can openly buy, roll and smoke a joint.</strong> People around that area seemed very relaxed, and many foreigners are smoking weed there.

It’s very common around SEA, but you never know.  For instance, in Da Nang, there is an expat area where people openly roll and smoke joints. When you’re walking around the streets,<strong> you will smell cannabis on each step.</strong> Everyone knows about the situation, and many pubs are selling and paying the cops. Anyway, there was a huge bust in one of the pubs where many foreigners and locals were arrested.  <em>After all, who knows how the bribery works with dirty cops?</em>  <img class=\"size-full wp-image-3986\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.high-times-hanoi.jpg\" alt=\"Best idea is to smoke in secluded spots and just enjoy the vibes!\" width=\"1499\" height=\"843\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Best idea is to smoke in secluded spots and just enjoy the vibes!</em></div>  We suggest you to <strong>get cannabis in those places</strong> and get out as soon as possible. Always <strong>smoke at secluded places</strong> where you can be aware of your surroundings, and you’ll be fine.  Alright, let’s go back to our experiences with cannabis...  In Hanoi, the price of the bag was <strong>250k VND for 5 grams</strong> of surprisingly good cannabis. We bought four bags that will last until Da Nang where we planned to restore our stash.  The first thought when having few baggies of weed in our luggage was the police.  <em>What happens if the cops stop us and find cannabis on us?</em>  We researched the police situation in Vietnam, and after reading experiences, we realized it’s totally fine as there is a <strong>small possibility you’ll get pulled over by the police in Vietnam.</strong> In short, we just packed the baggies in dirty clothes, just to be sure!  <img class=\"size-full wp-image-3983\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.phong-nha-enjoy.jpg\" alt=\"Phong Nha offers some breathtaking nature for its visitors.

Enjoying weed is also pretty easy here!</em></div>  We were running out of weed in Phong Nha, two more locations before reaching Da Nang. Luckily for us, the small town is <strong>full of tourists which means cannabis should be around.</strong> We booked a hotel there and instantly saw a guy on the reception wearing a hat with cannabis leaf! That was more than enough for us to talk to him!  He was able to sell it, but in inflated price, so we decided to skip it and try to preserve our reserves till Da Nang. When we were leaving the hotel, the guy approached us and gave us a gram of his stash for lucky travels. Such a good guy!  <img class=\"wp-image-3984 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.hue-streets.jpg\" alt=\"In the streets of Hue, you will most likely be spotted by guys on motorbikes who will follow you around and try to sell you marijuana.

(in a very funny accent!)</em></div>  After Phong Nha, we headed to the Imperial city of Hue for a night. We were surprised how many taxi drivers offer you cannabis. You walk around the streets, and in 10 minutes <strong>you’ll get approached by ten drivers asking you about marijuana.</strong> It’s very annoying after some time since the same drivers will approach you multiple times! We heard many bad experiences about these drivers trying to rip off tourists and even working closely to police reporting people and sharing the bribe with police. Simply, <strong>say a friendly no</strong> to these offers and walk away!  <img class=\"size-full wp-image-3985\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.joint-rooftop.jpg\" alt=\"Many joints were smoked on this rooftop!\" width=\"1184\" height=\"888\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Many joints were smoked on this rooftop!</em></div>  And then, we arrived in stunning Da Nang. We were utterly blown away by the city and its vibe. Really fantastic place to be! The expat community is huge and growing with each day. <strong>Weed bars are everywhere</strong>, and you can quickly get good quality cannabis for a fair price. Us three were able to find many pubs where nice people gather and smoke cannabis openly. We joined for a few nights and restocked our supplies that will last us till Saigon (it was just our plan).  Getting to Saigon without any weed? No worries, here\'s everything you have to know about <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/weed-in-saigon\"><strong>weed in Saigon</strong></a>.  <img class=\"size-full wp-image-3991\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.da-nang-beach.jpg\" alt=\"The beautiful Da Nang beach.\" width=\"1184\" height=\"888\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>The beautiful Da Nang beach.</em></div>  Da Nang is a crazy beautiful city with a <strong>great combination of urban and natural beauties.</strong> You can’t be bored in the city, and there are great nature spots that give you the view over the city and long sandy beach. Perfect place for smoking some cannabis and relax. We smoked so much weed in Da Nang, so we needed to restock a few times before leaving. Our stop in Da Nang lasted only four days!  <img class=\"size-full wp-image-3974\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.antonio-smoking.jpg\" alt=\"Enjoying the joint in Phan Thiet!\" width=\"1499\" height=\"843\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Enjoying the joint in Phan Thiet!</div>  The stash of ours lasted till the beautiful coastal town called Phan Thiet. We stayed there for five days spoiling ourselves on the beach and simply relaxing before ending our trips. It was an easy task to smoke all of our stash since we had just one bag left. <strong>Many taxi drivers around ATMs</strong> will offer you cannabis or something that looks like cannabis. We heard many scams with these drivers, so be careful if you decide to buy from them.  Of course, we bought one bag from them, and it was really expensive for the quality and quantity you get. We didn’t experience any scam except weed was really really bad!  When we reflect on our overall experience with cannabis in Vietnam, we must tell that <strong>we feel extremely lucky that nothing bad happened.</strong> The country is very corrupt, and the laws related to cannabis are very strict. We didn’t pay any bribe or getting in trouble with police officers along the way.  Personally, we smoked a bit too much since <strong>we managed to finish around 60 grams of cannabis in 30 days of traveling.</strong>  Our honest advice is to <strong>always use common sense</strong>, and if something feels not right, then it’s probably not right. Listen to your intuition and just skip these situations. Be careful when buying from street dealers as there are many scams involved. The best advice would be to <strong>connect with the expat community or check the groups on Facebook</strong>, so you will definitely get your hands on a piece of valuable information. <h2><strong>Final Words for Cannabis Enthusiasts</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-3973 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.da-nang.jpg\" alt=\"We had a great overall experience with cannabis in Vietnam!\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1690\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>We had a great overall experience with cannabis in Vietnam!</em></div>  <em><strong>People who love cannabis won’t have many problems in Vietnam. </strong></em>As you already know, Vietnam is a stunning country with <strong>many breathtaking natural wonders and crazy beautiful roads</strong>, so it perfectly goes along with cannabis.  In major cities, cannabis isn’t seen as a vice by young people, and there is a huge community of smokers. The countryside is different since the values and traditions are still strongly expressed, so you will have a hard time finding some cannabis around the country and many strange looks when smoking around locals.  Use your common sense when doing anything cannabis related and you will be more than fine.  If something doesn’t feel right at first, then you should definitely skip it!  <em><strong>What is your experience with cannabis in Vietnam?

Every province has quite different requirements and process when it comes to getting a new driving permit or converting your IDP.</div>  Once you’re done with your application, you need to verify and translate it.

If you\'re not working in Vietnam and don\'t have a work permit/TRC, the best bet to stay longer is by doing a visa run. At first, the whole process might sound complicated and scary but believe us, it\'s very straightforward to do successfully do your visa run. We did quite a lot of visa runs crossing to Laos and Cambodia on our motorbikes without experiencing any problems. Keep reading as we\'ve included all the details required for a successful Vietnam visa run.  <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Article Update: </strong>We\'ve completed the last visa run in October 2019. This version differs from the last one as you we\'ve included more border crossings and details about each crossing. For now, it seems effortless to do a visa run and there is no limitation on the number of visa runs you can do. There are some talks about setting the limitations, but nothing actual still.</span> <h2><strong>Getting All Required Documents on Time</strong></h2> Before heading to the border, be sure to obtain all the documents for your new Vietnam visa.  Here is the list of required documents and costs: <h3><strong>#1 Visa</strong><strong> approval letter</strong></h3> Be sure that you acquire a visa approval letter at least a few days before doing a visa run. The easiest way to get your letter is by contacting local visa agents who\'ll send you a letter in 2 - 3 days. We always use services from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lynn.visaviet.1\">Lynn in Da Nang</a>, a lovely lady who always sends us letters in 3 days! The price for a 3-month single entry approval letter is $25. Be sure to bring an original letter since, on the land border, the immigration asks for the original letter with the red stamp and signature. Check if the dates and passport numbers are matching.  <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>UPDATE: </strong>If you\'re planning to do a visa run by flying out/in Vietnam, having a copy of the invitation letter is fine. </span> <h3><strong>#2- Passport-sized photos </strong></h3> Don\'t forget to take a few passport-sized photos with you. Even if you don\'t have photos that match the format, the immigration officer will hand the scissors to make the correct size (they aren\'t strict about the size). If you don\'t have photos, there is a penalty of $2 which differs depending on the border and \'mood\' of immigration officers. Also, you have to pay at the border for a passport photo, which costs around $10 for a single photo! You can get photos everywhere in Vietnam, and it typically costs around 50,000 - 100,000 VND. <h3><strong>#3- Valid passport with at least four blank pages </strong></h3> Check your passport and be sure that you have at least four blank visa pages and six more months before passport expiration. <h2><strong>Vietnam Visa Run - A Step-by-Step Process</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4303 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20181128_135619.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnam Visa Run, Apply for a visa on arrival\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  We\'ve never experienced any problems during visa runs. Immigration officers tend to be very friendly (we even had a coffee with officers who were practicing English in Ha Tien) and helpful. A visa run process is the same for every border crossing, so no need for worry.  Since we\'re traveling around Vietnam and always coming back, we\'ve completed quite a few visa runs: <ul>   <li>Lao Bao (Vietnam)</li>   <li>Moc Bai (Cambodia)</li>   <li>Nam Phao (Laos)</li>   <li>Ha Tien (Cambodia)</li> </ul> <h3><strong>#1 - Get your invitation letter on time</strong></h3> Get an invitation letter from a reputable agency or someone affiliated with these agencies. Usually, it takes up to 3 working days to get the invitation letter from the agent. We pay $17 for a 3-month single entry and $25 for a multiple-entry approval letter.  <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>UPDATE: </strong>You must have an original letter (red stamp) for land borders, but a printed letter is fine for international airports.</span> <h3><strong>#2- Plan your transportation</strong></h3> Book a visa van or a bus or drive on your own to the border. We recommend driving on your own since the scenery is always stunning as you’re passing through breathtaking passes in the middle of Highlands to reach the borders. The van services usually cost around $50 - $100 depending on your location and how far is the border. It’s a convenient option since the people will support you during the whole visa run process.  We\'ve never done a visa run without driving our bikes. The scenery is beautiful, you meet new people, try new food and experience different provinces around Vietnam. There are a few agents in Da Nang who charge $100 for a whole visa run process including the cost of letter and visas. <h3><strong>3- Stamp out of Vietnam (Vietnam Exit Formalities)</strong></h3> Once you’re on the border, you need to show the passport and the invitation letter. The immigration officer will check out everything, and if everything is okay, they will stamp you out of Vietnam. After that, you’re officially not able to stay in Vietnam anymore. <h3><strong>#4- Apply for a Lao/Cambodian visa on arrival (Laos/Cambodia Entry Formalities)</strong></h3> At the border, you pass one more passport control, and then you head to Laos/Cambodia immigration office. There are always a few cafes and local restaurants where you can fill yourself up.  Once you reach Laos/Cambodia immigration office, you need to show your documents, including a passport, two passport-sized photos, and the invitation letter. Then you will get a few forms to fill up with your information, and after you’re done, they will ask you to pay for a 1-month visa that costs around $35 (depending on your nationality).  Once you acquire a new visa sticker, you have to stamp out from that country. Always check the dates on the stamps since there were stories of people overstaying because immigration officers messed with their stamps. <h3><strong>#5 - Stamp out of Laos/Cambodia and enter Vietnam again (Vietnam Entry Formalities)</strong></h3> Once you reach the Vietnam border, immigration will check your passport and visa again and point you in the right direction. A 3-month single entry visa costs $25, and you get it by showing the invitation letter and filling the forms. The immigration officer will stamp your passport (be sure to check it yourself) and point you in the right direction where another immigration officer will do the final check of your passport.  That’s all!  There are many steps, but usually, it goes like a charm, and you spend about 1 hour for the whole process once you reach the border. Even if you\'re going to do a visa run alone and don\'t know Vietnamese, don\'t stress yourself as immigration officers work with foreigners on a daily basis. <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Tips to Make a Vietnam Visa Run Effortless</strong></h2> <p id=\"OyfFkoG\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5576 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dd90685c37d9.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnam Visa Run, Ha Tien Border Crossing\" width=\"1063\" height=\"791\" /></p>  <h3><strong>#1- Bring passport-sized photos with you</strong></h3> Don’t forget to bring photos since immigration will charge you like $10 for a single photo. Also, there are penalties for not having a passport photo (usually $2). You can take photos everywhere in Vietnam. Head over to the nearest Photocopy (or PhotocoPPy) shop and ask for passport photos. The bunch of photos costs about 50,000 - 100,000 VND. <h3><strong>#2- Always check stamps and don\'t forget to stamp out before entering Vietnam</strong></h3> Don’t forget to stamp out of Laos/Cambodia if you don’t want to walk twice. It happened to my friend once during the crazy high temperatures, and you don’t want that. Be sure that you check all the stamps in your passport before heading back to the Vietnam border.  If you’re traveling by bike, there is parking before the Vietnam border, where you can park your bike for free and pick it up later. <h3><strong>#3- USD is a king </strong></h3> Pay in dollars! Exchange money before heading to the border as paying in local currency is always more expensive since officers like to get some money due to adverse exchange rates they give you. <h3><strong>#4- Bring the original visa approval letter</strong></h3> If you\'re planning to pass through land borders, it\'s required to have an original approval letter with a red stamp. You can have a printed letter if you\'re planning to fly in Vietnam through international airports. <h2><strong>How to Do a Visa Run Through Land Borders</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-4024 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20180604_082531.jpg\" alt=\"Land border crossings\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>A beautiful nature, a lot of small lakes and wild rivers will be your company along the way to Laos.

When it comes to weed, cannabis laws are very strict on paper, but in practice, it\'s a totally different story.  Hanoi is a very vibrant city that radiates with culture and tradition. Certain developments were being made, but still, you can walk around the center and enjoy local cuisine, drinks, and vibe. What could be a better way to dip in the experience than lightning some cannabis?  <em>We traveled to Hanoi and did research, so in this article, you\'ll get all the information on getting and smoking weed in Hanoi.</em>  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> <strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This article was not written to promote the use of illegal substances, but to make their consumption as safe as possible.

Don\'t forget to use your common sense and don\'t be a stereotypical tourist in Asia! ;)</em></div>  Like we already mentioned, Vietnam has very strict laws when it comes to drugs, and yeah, the government put the weed in the same category as opium and other very destructive drugs.  There are many stories and articles about \'horror\' stories when it comes to smoking weed in Hanoi, but through our experience and talks with other people, we have a totally different impression.  According to their laws, any activity related to cannabis is strictly illegal and you can end up in prison for a long time if you get caught. Also, there are some mentions in the law that you can get executed for cultivating or selling a lot of plants.  <strong>Read more: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/cannabis-in-vietnam\">All about cannabis in Vietnam!</a></strong>  Vietnam recently opened themselves to investors, so it\'s an emerging tourism country, especially for Chinese tourists. When you look at the laws, the majority of them doesn\'t apply to tourists, especially when we\'re talking about cannabis. <div data-gyg-href=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/default/activites.frame\" data-gyg-locale-code=\"en-US\" data-gyg-widget=\"activities\" data-gyg-number-of-items=\"3\" data-gyg-currency=\"USD\" data-gyg-partner-id=\"781AB6P\" data-gyg-q=\"Hanoi\"></div> <script async defer src=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js\"></script> There are so many expats in Hanoi who are openly smoking around the city and even in some bars. Hanoi is popular for a few bars where you can buy and smoke weed without any trouble.  Just use your common sense and smoke in secluded places where you\'re not surrounded by thousands of tourists and you\'ll be fine. In case you get caught with cannabis, you\'ll probably get outside the trouble by bribing the police.  <em><strong>Note #1: </strong>Vietnam, as a whole country, is very known for corruption. Police officers don\'t have a huge salary and they see the business opportunity when they catch a western tourist. Don\'t be hesitant to offer a bribe and also don\'t accept the first price as these bribes are highly negotiable. Just use your common sense all the time and you\'ll be fine.</em>  <em><strong>Advice: </strong>Always have a separated wallet with <strong>500,000 - 1,000,000VND</strong> ($20 - $40) in case you have to pay a bribe. The reason for that is, in some cases, police will take everything from your wallet if they notice more money. This amount of money can get you outside small trouble connected with cannabis.</em> <h2><strong>Where to Get Weed in Hanoi</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-4247 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.where-to-get-cannabis.jpg\" alt=\"Cannabis plant\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>From taxi drivers, weed-friendly pubs to delivery to your doors. The options are endless!</em></div>  It\'s very easy to get your hands on weed in Hanoi, but it\'s harder to get a good deal. If you don\'t have much time to explore Hanoi and you want to get cannabis fast, our advice is to visit Hoan Kiem Lake in the Old Quarter. During the night hours, the taxi drivers will usually offer you a motorbike ride and marijuana.  If you decide to take cannabis from them you should always check the bag as there are many scams when they put some other herbs or tea instead of cannabis. Also, the prices are high for a schwag you\'ll get. The price in the Old Quarter is around <strong>200,000VND ($20) for a gram.</strong>  If you have more time in Hanoi, we suggest you visit a few smoking pubs and bars where you can openly smoke. There are many places around the city like these, mainly known by expats. Our advice is to join the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/hanoiexpat/about/\">group with other 16,000 expats</a> in Hanoi and meet up with some to get insights not only for weed in Hanoi.  There are many pubs/bars where you can score decent quality cannabis. Try out the <strong>Tet Bar in Hoan Kiem District, Apini Pub near Flower Market or Rastaman Pub in Tay Ho</strong>. We know these three places, but there are more places popping out with each day.  <em><strong>Note: </strong>Don\'t be afraid to smoke in these pubs as these are kind of rackets with police. The owners are paying a bribe for a certain period which means no police controls of these pubs during these periods.</em>  There is a delivery guy who can deliver the highest-quality homegrown and imported buds directly to your doorstep! Check out <a href=\"http://hanoistoners.blogspot.com/\">his page</a> and what he\'s got to offer! :)  Another good way to score some weed is by checking backpacker hostels around Hanoi. These are filled with westerners who are looking for crazy time in Hanoi. Ask people who\'re working on reception and they will probably help you out! <h2><strong>Cannabis Prices in Hanoi</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4244\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.enjoy-hanoi.jpg\" alt=\"Bridge over Red River in Hanoi\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" />  The prices for a schwag are very low, but also the quality of the bud follows the price. For 5 grams in pubs, you can expect to pay around <strong>200,000VND </strong>($10) which is a great deal. Also, weed quality is decent!  If you\'re buying from taxi drivers, you can expect to get the low-quality schwag filled in a cigarette pack. The price of around 10 grams is around <strong>400,000VND</strong> ($20). Taxi drivers will always ask you for more, but always negotiate the price in Vietnam!  There is an option to get your hands on imported kush from Laos and Cambodia, but it will cost you around <strong>500,000VND</strong> ($25) for a gram.  <hr />  The cannabis laws on the paper are very strict, but in the practice, it\'s very easy to get and smoke cannabis discretely. Just use your common sense to avoid trouble with the police. Also, don\'t forget to bargain all the time as it\'s the part of the culture in Vietnam!

(12717, 3, '2019-03-19 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'Many people ask how the celebration of the most meaningful Vietnamese holiday look like. It\'s literally impossible to write a detailed answer to a dozen of people who asked me that question, so I figured out the best way would be to share the experience here. I mean, it\'s the main purpose of blogging, isn\'t it?  The whole journey and celebration of Tet holiday have a special meaning to me and it made the connection between Vietnamese people and me so much stronger. Once again, they showed their extreme hospitality and friendliness. Also, it\'s strange, but we became so good at understanding each other without even talking the same language. Sometimes, we were able to talk like for an hour without having the single word on the common language, but a body language is a universal tool of communication. Such an amazing thing to experience!  <em>I want to say big THANK YOU to all Vietnamese people and my dear friends who shared this beautiful journey with me! If there is something I\'m certain of, then it is the thing that the journey won\'t be the same without all of you!</em> <h2><strong>How Did Tet Holiday Celebration Look for Me?</strong></h2> Well, it was amazing and at some moments very blurry and hard to remember since Vietnamese people love their alcohol (and me too)! Sometimes even too much. If you ever come to drink with locals, be prepared that they are very proud drinkers and they will definitely try to outdrink you.  I was lucky that during my time in Vietnam I was living with few families and met a crazy amount of local people in Da Nang while volunteering. Many people invited me to their homes during Tet, but I was only able to visit a few.  The final decision was to visit three provinces - Ha Tinh, Nghe An and Thanh Hoa.  The whole trip lasted for a bit more than two weeks and I stayed with three families, one in each province.  I was driving \'Dragan\', my trustworthy Honda Wave that passed through heavens and hells with me but still rocking solid. My beloved bike clocked just a bit less than 2,000 km on this trip.  I decided to try something different in this article - going visual with a bit of text since the picture says 1,000 words.  <em><strong>Well, in the end, why not to try and test new things?</strong></em>  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> <strong>Note:</strong> All photos were taken by my phone that was slowly dying on the way and these are not the highest quality, but can definitely show you the vibe and how it all looked like. </div> <h2><strong>1st stop - Ky An, a small industrial village in Ha Tinh province</strong></h2> In Ky An, I was invited by a good friend Vu who I met in Da Nang. I was living with his family for four days and during that time I\'ve met so many people, friends, and family. Also, I experienced the culinary heaven of traditional food and rich preparations for the Tet holiday.  <em>Here you can feel the vibe from that special place:</em>  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4182\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190127_101950.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  Overlooking Ky An was really nice. People in that small village are mainly Catholic and it\'s shocking how many churches they have. Also, they put an extreme amount of effort and money to build those since they pay attention to every detail.  It always looks foggy around here, but it\'s actually not a fog - these are the gases from the huge international corporation that is located here.  It creates jobs around here as it seems like every person works for the corporation which is good short-term, but again, they are slowly killing their sea and air which will definitely come with the price for this and many other generations. Also, don\'t forget that the majority of people around here lives from seafood and farming.   What\'s your thought on it? Are you for a short-term or long-term? Or maybe you see a balanced option that can benefit all the people now, but also, won\'t have a negative effect on generations to come? </div> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4183\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190127_103408.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  We moved down from the hill and visited the church. It\'s still in a construction phase without much work being put on. Around the church, there are many community buildings where locals usually hang around. Also, kids play football on the rocky field barefoot. <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4184\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190127_103852.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3120\" height=\"4160\" />  This is how the church looks like now. It\'s probably one of three or four churches around there. Maybe there are even more, who knows? You can see they are done with outside construction and they slowly moved to detail phase. It\'s funny that only a few people work on it and they are definitely taking their time while working on it. Read, having thousand smoke and beer breaks. <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4185\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190127_122738.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  Vietnamese people love their coffee time! They have such a strong coffee culture and amazing coffee (mainly robusta, for coffee enthusiasts). We usually drink Ca Phe Sua Da which is translated as coffee with milk and ice. If you never tried <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide\">Vietnamese coffee</a> don\'t be surprised how creamy and sweet it is. They use condensed milk as a sweetener that gives a special creamy texture. Some people can\'t stand it as at the times, it can be extremely sweet!  Also, you always get free tea and you can drink as much as you can. Tea is very tasty and sometimes really strong. Depending on the province, people combine different snacks that go well with coffee - in Ha Tinh, they like their sunflower and watermelon seeds. It is so easy to make a mess! <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4186 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190127_123115.jpg\" alt=\"Sunflower seeds everywhere\" width=\"3120\" height=\"4160\" />  After a few minutes, the floor looked like this! It was full of sunflower seed shells and it\'s totally normal around here. Everyone is throwing everything on the floor and people just don\'t mind. The bartender just swipes it away once the people leave the table and the floor is ready for new customers faster than a blink of the eye. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4187 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190127_133503.jpg\" alt=\"Playing video games\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  Oh yeah, not to forget - a gaming culture is huge among Vietnamese youth. It was very impressive and at the same time shocking to bump on these gaming rooms everywhere! Literally, there are places with nothing, just a few stores and of course a full gaming room. Majority of these works during the whole night, so many young people come there before sleep to play some games with friends.  It\'s also very shocking to me to see very young kids spending hours there instead of playing outside and experiencing a beautiful nature. How different is the childhood now! Not judging, since Croatia and other parts of the world are no different. But just an interesting observation when you how a traditional lifestyle is slowly getting influenced by technology and modern lifestyle.<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4188 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190127_143636.jpg\" alt=\"Catching our own food\" width=\"3120\" height=\"4160\" />  In the countryside, you reap what you sow. We were catching some chickens for the barbeque later. People around here don\'t earn much money, but they usually live in their house with the family, raising animals and growing their own food. People here live self-sustainable and it\'s nice to be around there as you learn many things about the food and the way they grow and treat the food. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4189 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190127_220637.jpg\" alt=\"Rice wine and hot pot goes together\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  A blurry photo is posted for the purpose! People in Vietnam love their drinking time! It\'s called Nhau and it\'s basically drinking and eating without any reason. They are doing it almost every night with their friends and family. It\'s amazing how good and diverse food they eat. Of course, there is no Nhau without beers and tons of rice wine.  It\'s sometimes annoying when you focus on eating and every second someone wants to cheers with you. After a while, you forget and don\'t mind.  Also, they have a culture of drinking everything bottoms up, even the beers. That\'s so heavy for the stomach and I\'m struggling to keep up with their beer drinking pace. At the table, you can see their iconic hot pot. They burn a fire below the pot and inside the pot, there is a liquid or a broth. When the broth is getting hot, the mix raw meat and fresh vegetables to make a delicious soup! <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4190 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190128_133635.jpg\" alt=\"Beach in Ky An\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  One of the fishermen villages I had a chance to visit. The beach is visibly polluted by all kind of human waste, like almost every beach in Vietnam. People here are simply not educated about pollution and its effects on the environment. Also, it seems like it\'s in their culture to litter.  Anyway, people around Ky An live mainly as industrial workers, farmers and fishermen. It\'s very crazy to see huge industrial boats on the horizon. This part of the sea is totally flocked with these kinds of boats. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4191 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190128_140507.jpg\" alt=\"Homemade fish sauce and shrimp paste\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  This is the local way how to make a fish sauce and shrimp paste. I personally don\'t like any of it but can eat the fish sauce with some food. Shrimp sauce has a very strong smell to me and I\'m simply allergic to it. The woman was showing me how she makes both sauces and what kind of fish and shrimps she is using. It was a good knowledge to get since these two are basically staple sauces when it comes to Vietnamese cuisine. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4192 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190128_142158.jpg\" alt=\"Fresh local food\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  All that you can see on the table is fresh and locally made. That\'s what I\'m thinking when I\'m talking about self-sustainability. People don\'t have much, but they have everything they need. The food is very delicious and fresh.  We were eating cooked squid combined with rice paper and tasty mint. Also, there are baby shrimps that are used to make a shrimp paste and some kind of beef sauce that goes good with food above. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4193 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190128_164854.jpg\" alt=\"Preparation of Banh Chung\" width=\"3120\" height=\"4160\" />  Many locals don\'t use the gas or electric stoves - they simply build a fire and cook on it. In this huge pot, there is a traditional food called Banh Chung which is the sticky rice combined with some beans and sometimes meat. It\'s a traditional food for Tet holiday and it can make you totally full in seconds. It\'s full of calories and people usually mix it with sugar when eating.  I\'m not a huge fan of it but can eat a few pieces. They also wrap it in banana leaves and it looks like a wrapped gift. It\'s a good gift for the families while visiting in the time of Tet holiday.<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4194 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190128_203019.jpg\" alt=\"Preparing chicken for BBQ\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  Preparing a chicken we caught before for the barbeque. People here seem like they are doing it every day so they are doing it so fast. As you can see, they have football dresses on since they just came from a football match. Football is a huge thing around there and almost everyone is playing football.  They have teams and they compete against other teams. People just rent a football field and play against each other. It\'s such a good and healthy way to connect with people, but also it\'s a good excuse to drink after. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4195 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190128_215322.jpg\" alt=\"Enjoying a delicious dinner\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  A chicken that we caught before. We were dipping the chicken in all kind of spicy sauces while drinking a beer. People here love spicy food as it makes you thirsty and what\'s the better way to kill your thirst than drinking a cold beer.  Also, Vietnamese people usually drink everything with a ton of ice. I don\'t personally like to drink a beer with the ice, but in Vietnam, it\'s hard to avoid it. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4196 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190129_131203.jpg\" alt=\"Ky An market\" width=\"3120\" height=\"4160\" />  It was so funny experience buying a winter hat since it was very cold to drive around that time. We went to the local market and soon, there were like 20 people around us looking at me as an alien. I guess they rarely see a foreigner.  They were very friendly and treated me very nice. Also, there were some people talking English, so they were asking me do I need any help or what I\'m looking for. Such a nice bunch of people.<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4197 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190129_132504.jpg\" alt=\"Ky Anh market\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  Local markets in Vietnam are very colorful and lively. You can buy literally anything there and it\'s the place where some people socialize as there are few local eateries and cafes around. I always have a great time just walking around these markets.  <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4200 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190129_155856.jpg\" alt=\"In Ha Tinh countryside\" width=\"3120\" height=\"4160\" />  After a few amazing days in Ky An, it was time to say goodbye and move a bit north to visit another friend in Com Xuyen. It\'s a small village located on the off skirts of Ha Tinh city. The place is beautiful, but the people are noticeably scared of foreigners (or just me?). I was lost around since it\'s very hard to find an exact house there and I was asking people for help and in some moments they were really terrified and running away from me.  It was probably because I didn\'t remove the full face helmet and people rarely or never saw a foreigner around. Anyway, I spent like an hour driving around these beautiful rice fields while looking for my friends\' house. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4201 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190129_162941.jpg\" alt=\"A proper Vietnamese meal\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  After finally meeting each other, we went to eat and drink a few beers. He invited me to a traditional restaurant to eat duck liver salad. It was very tasty. You always mix it with rice bread and fish sauce mixed with garlic and chill peppers.  Also, a cold beer goes so good together since all of this food is a bit spicy. I was literally starving at that point so I ordered a chicken soup which isn\'t on the picture. <h2><strong>2nd stop - Vinh City, the center of Nghe An province</strong></h2> After visiting my friend in Ha Tinh, my goal was to reach Vinh City where a good friend of mine is working and living. I planned to stay one night and to continue my way to Cau Giat, a town where I was <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/starlight-english-center-vietnam\">volunteering as an English teacher</a>. On the first night, I knew I will prolong my stay there since I\'ve been to Vinh City many times, but never had a chance to roam around the city.  <em>Here are a few photos from Vinh City:</em>  <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4204 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190130_115333.jpg\" alt=\"Huge bowl of fried rice\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  Fried rice - one of my favorite dishes around Vietnam. It\'s different as you travel through the country and also, it has a different name. For instance, in the north, it\'s called Com Rang, while in central Vietnam it\'s called Com Chien. I was missing a huge bowl of fried rice so much! I was driving around Vinh in the morning and I was aimlessly looking for a place to eat.  I always go to the restaurants or street places where I see a lot of locals eating. You know you will get amazing food for an affordable price there. I saw a Pho place filled with locals, so I was like, let\'s check it out. As soon as I got inside I saw they are preparing fried rice and I was like, let\'s eat it! It was so delicious and so huge! I almost couldn\'t finish the bowl! It was so good to eat it again. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4205 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190130_125143.jpg\" alt=\"Driving through rice fields\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  On the way to Ho Chi Minh\'s hometown. It\'s a small village located just outside Vinh city. The whole distance is about 15 kilometers, but it\'s easy to get lost around countless rice fields that are around. The road is pretty nice and you\'re passing through small and charming towns where you can stay for a quick caffeine refill. The most amazing thing for me on the route is that you can drive through rice fields and small villages which gives you a completely different experience. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4206 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190130_132103.jpg\" alt=\"The place where Ho Chi Minh was born\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  It\'s the house where Ho Chi Minh was born. The house is fully built from bamboo and palm tree leaves. Also, people living in that period were extremely short as the ceiling is so low. Another interesting thing from the house is that they didn\'t have a furnished floor as every floor was just made of mud. The house inside is totally traditional and simple.  People had few bamboo beds, one or two hammocks and a traditional kitchen where they were setting the fire and cook directly on the fire. And yeah, they had tiny gardens around the house where they were raising all kinds of vegetables and sugar cane. It was a pretty simple, but self-sustainable lifestyle around there. Also, I bet they weren\'t littering on each step like they usually do nowadays.<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4207 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190130_133842.jpg\" alt=\"Stunning gardens\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  This is the rest of the village where Ho Chi Minh was born. The village is very well preserved as many workers are taking care of it. It really amazed me how actually the whole place looks so furnished and chilled since there are not many visitors there (at least not at the time when I was visiting). <h2><strong>3rd stop - Cau Giat in Nghe An</strong></h2> Cau Giat is a small town located on the national highway QL1. The town is 250 km southern from Hanoi and about 60 km northern from Vinh. It\'s a very meaningful destination for me since I spent 4 months volunteering as an English teacher there. I haven\'t seen people and the place for about 6 months, so I was very excited to come there.  My initial plan was to stay there for two days, but I prolonged it to 4 days since there were some old friends coming in and I met amazing new friends on the way. It was very hard to leave one more time.  <em>Here are some photos from my time in Cau Giat:</em>  <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4211 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190131_151300.jpg\" alt=\"Rice fields in Cau Giat\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  Ah, that smell of the rice fields...It\'s simply hard to explain the smell, but it smells like home. Majority of people in Cau Giat live from the rice, livestock, seafood (a bit out of the town, but in the district) and there is a huge pineapple plantation near. It\'s amazing to see that many people and households are almost totally self-sustainable.  Even they don\'t earn much money on a monthly basis, they manage to have their basic needs met. It struck me all the time to see that we don\'t need much to survive and live a good life. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4212 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190131_152033.jpg\" alt=\"Overlooking national highway\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  That\'s the bridge across QL1 national highway in Cau Giat. I was usually coming here during the night to just chill and drink a beer with fellow volunteers. Also, this place is always filled with people after 8 pm. Some people come here to socialize, some people even come here to train. It\'s a lively place at night and really cool to be here one more time. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4213 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190131_181002.jpg\" alt=\"Meeting my students\" width=\"3120\" height=\"4160\" />  I was randomly driving around the town to get the vibe, and stumble upon these twins! They were my students back when I was teaching here. Their family has a small clothing shop so I saw them playing with some toy rifles in front of the shop. I pulled the motorbike and said hello, but they ran  behind the counter just looking at me with the smile. I was calling them and they were a bit shy but they remembered me. After a minute they run to me and hug me. It was a very emotional moment and we were hugging each other for minutes. It was an amazing feeling when you see your students after a long time. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4214 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190131_230634.jpg\" alt=\"Coming home\" width=\"2592\" height=\"1944\" />  Quang and Sue, the part of the family. I missed these two kids so much! They are growing so fast and they are getting much better at English. It\'s such a pleasure to see these kids are growing in a positive direction so fast. We had a lot of fun during these few days. They were showing me many tricks and plays they learned during the time I was away.  <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4215 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190201_130354.jpg\" alt=\"Rice fields in Cau Giat are magnificent\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  There is a small hill overlooking the whole town where I usually went when I needed to recharge my batteries. In Cau Giat there are three rice harvests per year and no matter which time you go to the hill, you have a different vibe and a look. I love to play the guitar and sing songs on that hill.  Also, remembered the moment when I bring my brother here. We were just sitting here, drinking beers, looking at the stars and talking about life. This hill is definitely magical and holds a special place in my heart. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4216 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190201_145149.jpg\" alt=\"Trying different Ao Dai costumes\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  Ao Dai is a Vietnamese traditional dress that people usually wear during weddings or special and meaningful periods like Tet holiday. It\'s a very beautiful costume with many details. I was lucky to get invited by locals to the shop. I tried a few Ao Dai costumes, but they didn\'t have my size so it looked very funny. Did you know that you can get a tailored Ao Dai in Hoi An? It\'s a perfect idea for a <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/souvenirs-from-vietnam\"><strong>souvenir from Vietnam</strong></a> that will last.  The people who were wearing it were stunningly beautiful. We went outside and took some photos for the upcoming Tet holiday. In the shop, there were two funny kids who were eager to learn some English, so while the people were trying different dresses, I was playing with the kids. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4217 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190201_150528.jpg\" alt=\"A huge waiting line for ATM\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  A totally random photo, but needed to share it with you. This is the waiting line for the ATM! There are at least 30 people waiting in front of this ATM and it\'s impressive for me how chilled they are in the row. If that happens somewhere like in Croatia, someone would get hurt for sure! People are spending much money on decorating and preparing their homes for Tet holiday since it\'s their most meaningful holiday of the year and it can be quite expensive.  The same situation was in front of every ATM for a few days. One day I woke up around 6 to drive a bit and there were still waiting lines in that time! If you\'re traveling through Vietnam around Tet holiday, be sure to have cash prepared since you may end up in a waiting line! <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4218 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190201_152553.jpg\" alt=\"Orange trees acting like a Christmas tree\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  Does the photo above remind you of stacked decorated Christmas trees? People in Vietnam, instead of Christmas trees, have orange trees. It\'s very interesting since they decorate these trees with all kinds of colors and lights and it actually looks like the Christmas tree.  When it comes to oranges, people told me it\'s not good to eat since they used a huge amount of fertilizers when growing. Anyway, I tried a few oranges, and it was so bitter that I couldn\'t eat it. Probably people were right! <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4219 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190201_164901.jpg\" alt=\"Quynh Phuong beach in Quynh Luu district\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  Quynh Phuong, a beach located just 15 km away from Cau Giat. It\'s not touristic place and the beachfront just went through some minor developments like building a boardwalk and there are few restaurants. At that time, the beach was almost empty and nothing was working since almost every business is closed for Tet holiday. It was such a good vibe to chill and get a fresh breeze. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4220 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190202_125131.jpg\" alt=\"Famous Thuoc Lao\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  At the time of the trip, I was trying to stop smoking cigarettes, so I got hooked to this baby called Thuoc Lao. It\'s a bong mainly made from bamboo or in some instances from metal and people use it to get high. How does it work?  Well, you fill the pipe with tobacco, then burn and inhale the smoke. The tobacco is pretty strong and it gives you the lightheadedness feeling. Few times, I almost got unconscious after taking a big hit. Be careful when you\'re taking Thuoc Lao and always have some liquid next to you. People in the north simply love their Thuoc Lao and you can find it in almost every cafe or restaurant. In the central or South Vietnam, it\'s very hard to find one as the culture is a bit different. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4221 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190202_143109.jpg\" alt=\"Overlooking Quynh Nghia beach\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  Quynh Nghia beach from the mountain. We climbed the mountain and were prized with this view. It\'s a very nice way to recharge your batteries being near the sea on the fresh air. The place is about 15 km away from Cau Giat. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4222 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190203_160036.jpg\" alt=\"See you again Nghe An province\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  Every time when I see this sign, I get chills. I\'m very connected to Nghe An province and its people so I always feel weird when I\'m leaving. This time, I was driving the bike with my friend Chien and we were heading to his hometown in Thanh Hoa province that starts just after this sign. <h2><strong>4th stop - Thanh Hoa Province and Chien\'s Hometown</strong></h2> After a short but amazing visit to Cau Giat, I met Chien (a best friend from Da Nang) and together, we jumped on my motorbike and drove all the way to his hometown. I spent 4 days in his hometown and celebrated Tet holiday with his amazing family. There were many funny, crazy, scary and beautiful things that happened.  <em>Here are some pictures from Thanh Hoa province:</em>  <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4225 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190203_180425.jpg\" alt=\"My best friend Chien and me\" width=\"1944\" height=\"2592\" />  Chien and I just arrived in his hometown in Thanh Hoa. Nothing much of the picture, just to see our faces after his first trip with the motorbike outside Da Nang. He was driving the whole province and there were moments where I was completely scared for our lives. But luckily, we arrived safely at the destination.  His family greeted me with a few shots of beer and Thuoc Lao hits. In Vietnam, people are drinking bottoms up with beer and it really makes you drunk very fast since their pace is hard to follow. Also, they love to eat while drinking which is a great habit since the hungover is minimal. We were doing like that for the 3 days in a row, but after 3 days your body is simply telling you - STOP!<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4226 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190203_212728.jpg\" alt=\"In the karaoke room\" width=\"3120\" height=\"4160\" />  Vietnamese people are keen to their karaoke and it\'s the part of the culture. Friends and family gather together and usually sing their favorite songs while drinking overpriced beer and eating fruit salads. It\'s impressive how much effort they put in furnishing karaoke rooms. Every room looks so luxurious, even in the most remote places.  We got so drunk there and after a blast time in the karaoke room, we just continued with the party at Chien\'s family home. It\'s hard to be the only foreigner around these people as everyone wants to cheer with you and it\'s inevitable to stay sober. Some karaoke has a huge selection of the songs. In Da Nang, I was able to sing a few Croatian songs!<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4227 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190204_132559.jpg\" alt=\"A tasty and creamy egg coffee\" width=\"3120\" height=\"4160\" />  As I already mentioned, Vietnam has a deep coffee culture as well as their export of coffee is one of the highest in the world. Vietnamese people simply love their coffee with condensed milk. I must say it\'s one of the most delicious and strongest coffees I had a chance to try. This one is the best egg coffee I ever tried.  The egg coffee is made by mixing coffee, condensed milk and egg which gives you a tasty coffee with a strange creamy texture. Some people love it, while some people hate it. I\'m in the first category! Egg coffee is extremely popular in the north, mainly Hanoi, and it\'s a real struggle to find it in central or South Vietnam. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4228 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190204_164026.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful limestones in the middle of nowhere\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  The landscape around Thanh Hoa is stunning and it reminds me of Ninh Binh province that we had a chance to visit during our epic motorbike trip around the country. We took the bikes one day and randomly driving around to energize our bodies since it was a day before Tet. For Tet, you simply had to have a lot of energy since people drink like crazy and you can\'t expect to go to sleep early. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4229 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190204_165625.jpg\" alt=\"Overlooking Thanh Hoa city\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  This is the view over Thanh Hoa city from the monument that pays respect to heroic mothers during the American war. We were greeted with an amazing view and a beautiful sunset over the city. Such a unique moment to be there!  <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4230 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190205_014741.jpg\" alt=\"Celebrating Tet holiday as local\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  Ah, the night of Tet looked like this. We started to drink at 10 am in Chien\'s family house until 10 pm. During that time, I met a crazy amount of locals who were extraordinarily nice, and of course, they all wanted to cheer as the sign of welcome to their town. I was just trying to follow up and I made it! 12 hours of hard drinking!  I didn\'t know what was following...  Well, we came back to Chien\'s house around 10 pm and chill a bit while drinking a few beers and smoking a few Thuoc Lao. Chien asked me to go to visit his friend nearby. We went there and we got really drunk at that house. When we were going back to his house, we met his brother and friend on the street.  It was a group of 20 drunk people singing and going to visit every house around the town to give the best wishes for the Tet. We started our march to visit all the houses and the thing is that you have to drink in every house you visit. We started around 12 pm and I remembered throwing up in the lake around 4 am. Next day I woke up with a huge hungover, headache and I was unable to open my eye. Crazy night for sure it was!<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4231 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190205_173831.jpg\" alt=\"Stunning sunset\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  A beautiful sunset captured from Chien\'s house. It\'s amazing how simply people live here. They don\'t have much but they have enough!<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4232 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190205_191215.jpg\" alt=\"An eye virus\" width=\"1944\" height=\"2592\" />  Me next morning after Tet night. It looks like I got hit in the face, but no, I managed to get some eye virus. At first, I didn\'t want to take the medicine since I knew I will be drinking, but after Tet night it started to look very bad. I\'ve got some medicine and creams and everything settled to normal pretty fast. Some older people had it and they were told it\'s very dangerous and it can spread around the whole body. I was so lucky nothing serious happened.<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4233 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190206_124545.jpg\" alt=\"A proper lunch with the family\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  A traditional meal in Vietnam. People here eat very healthy and diverse cuisine. Usually, they put a bamboo mattress on the floor and stack the food around while people are sitting in the circle, next to each other. There is a lot of alcohol involved too, but luckily for me, I didn\'t drink any since I was on the medicine. Some people were drinking for 5 or 6 days in a row and still going strong. It\'s crazy how much Vietnamese people can drink. <h2><strong>Going back to Da Nang</strong></h2> After celebrating a lunar new year in Thanh Hoa it was time for me to return back to Da Nang. There was a long way in front of me and it was impossible to do it in one day, so I broke the trip in three parts. I visited family in Cau Giat again (along with visiting a friend from Da Nang around Quynh Luu district), stopped in Ky An to visit family and then from Ky An drove 350 km all the way to Da Nang.  <em>Here you can see a bit from the trip back home:</em>  <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4237 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190206_164048-Copy.jpg\" alt=\"Trying a betel nut on a traditional way\" width=\"3120\" height=\"4160\" />  On the picture above, you can see a traditional preparation of betel nut or quid. This nut has a significant meaning in Vietnam culture and today, you can see older people consuming it. Consuming this nut for long periods makes your teeth black, so that\'s one of the reasons you can stumble to people with complete black teeth. An interesting fact is that the black teeth were the standard for a beauty a long time ago.  The combination of a nut, powder and leave is used as chewing gum and the taste is similar to a minty gum. It\'s said it gives you energy and more brain power, but I really didn\'t get any of these effects. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4238 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190206_221328-Copy.jpg\" alt=\"Random drinking\" width=\"3120\" height=\"4160\" />  Meeting some random families around Cau Giat. I met few new friends in the small town, and they were visiting some friends, so I was going there with them. The families are always so warm and welcoming. You instantly feel as you\'re at home while visiting a Vietnamese family. Of course, there was a tea, rice wine, a lot of sunflower seeds and Thuoc Lao.  An interesting fact is that Vietnamese people believe the sunflower seeds will make you lose your voice. I don\'t know if it\'s true fact or they were just telling me that as I was literally killing all of their sunflower seeds. These seeds are so addictive! <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4239 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190207_123739-Copy.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting families around the country\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  This is another family I\'ve met in Quynh Luu district. It\'s about 15 km away from Cau Giat and these are father and mother of my friend from Da Nang. We didn\'t have a chance to spend more time together as the timing was very tight, but still, had a great time with, you can guess - a Thuoc Lao, strong tea and plenty of sunflower seeds. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4240 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190208_151528-Copy.jpg\" alt=\"A view from Hai Van pass. \" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  Almost reaching home! It\'s the view from the top of Hai Van Pass which is just 25 km away from Da Nang city center. I was greeted with sunny weather and not the best visibility. Usually, on clear days, you can see a whole city and the beach from this point.  This place is one of the top touristic places around central Vietnam, and I won\'t tell you about the beauties of the place since everyone is talking about it. I will tell you about the problem of littering! People, what\'s wrong with you?  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4241 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190209_104150-Copy.jpg\" alt=\"Linh Ung pagoda in Da Nang. \" width=\"3120\" height=\"4160\" />  I\'m living in Da Nang for the past 7 months and it was my first time visiting Linh Ung pagoda or how we like to call it; Lady Buddha. It was an amazing place that is by far overcrowded. But if you\'re patient, you can have a truly great experience and also, stunning views over the city. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4242 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190209_123130.jpg\" alt=\"Enjoying egg coffee and Thuoc Lao\" width=\"3120\" height=\"4160\" />  Getting a tasty cup of egg coffee (can\'t compare it to the one in Thanh Hoa!), few hits of Thuoc Lao and having a great day with an amazing person is the great way to put the end of this short, but meaningful journey.  <hr />  This was the overview of my two weeks on the road while celebrating Vietnamese New Year with local people. I have tons of pictures and so much more experiences to share, but it is impossible to include all of them. I\'m sorry if I didn\'t include something that was very meaningful to some locals that I met on the road, but believe me, I remember all of you guys!  <em>Thank you one more time for making Vietnam much closer to my heart!</em>', 'Celebrating Tet Holiday With Vietnamese People', 'TODO: Write Excerpt\r\n', 'draft', 'open', 'open', '', '', '', '', '2019-03-19 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', 0, 'http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/?p=12717', 0, 'post', '', 0);

Whenever someone mentions Vietnam, probably the first associations are delicious fresh food, wide smiles from friendly locals and breathtaking landscape on each step. What many people don\'t know is that Vietnam is one of the best kitesurfing locations in the WORLD!

Also, the climate makes Vietnam very attractive kitesurfing surfing location since the southern coast is gifted with reliable winds, tropical weather, stunning beaches, and surrounding landscape, and what\'s most important - a fast-growing kitesurfing community.  Kitesurfing in Vietnam became worldwide recognized and today, there are many locations where adventure junkies can find their place along the long coast.  Have you ever heard for Phan Rang?

The city has an ideal location for people who\'re traveling around Vietnam since it\'s literally situated between Nha Trang and Mui Ne on the coast and Da Lat in the mountains.  <em><strong>Every location is about 2 hours drive from quiet Phan Rang.</strong></em>  If you\'re looking for a quiet and authentic destination that luckily has pristine sandy beaches, stable winds, and local vibe, then you should definitely head over there! Majority of travelers who visit Phan Rang stays solely because of kitesurfing.  There are two main kitesurfing spots - <strong>My Hoa Lagoon and Ninh Chau Bay</strong> where you can catch nice winds and calm waters during the peak season (through the year too).  Locals mainly live from seafood and believe us, the seafood there is DELICIOUS! They know how to make a great meal with fresh food. There are a dozen of hiking spots, national parks and waterfalls around the city which you can explore between kitesurfing sessions. <h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Phan Rang Kitesurfing Season - When Is the Best Time to Visit?</strong></h1> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4285\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.phan-rang-kitesurfing-season.jpg\" alt=\"Phan Rang kitesurfing season\" width=\"914\" height=\"643\" />  Do you want to hear an interesting fact about Phan Rang?

The peak season for kitesurfing is from <strong>December to March</strong>. You can kitesurf during through the whole year, but the wind direction changes so you\'ll have to change a location a bit to catch a proper wind.  In Phan Rang, there are two seasons - <strong>high and low season</strong>. High season is often busier than a low season and the weather is more favorable for kitesurfers. It starts in October and ends around April when the low season kicks in. Many people usually visit Phan Rang during the peak (high) season, but if you don\'t have a chance to visit during these months, don\'t worry, since the weather and winds are stable even during the low season.  <a href=\"https://www.windy.com/11.577/108.987?10.963,108.987,8\"><strong>Here you can check the real-time wind conditions in Phan Rang!</strong></a> <h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Best Phan Rang Kitesurfing Spots</strong></h1> With an average of 25 knots, Phan Rang is the perfect spot for kitesurfers during the whole year.

If you\'re visiting during a peak season don\'t be surprised to get 40 knots!  <em>There are three places you want to be if you\'re coming to Phan Rang with kitesurfing in your mind:</em> <h2><strong>My Hoa Lagoon</strong></h2> <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/v7TWZVKvEv4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  The main spot for kite surfers is definitely My Hoa Lagoon. The lagoon is located on the South China Sea coast and the wind blows from N/NE direction with the a<strong>verage speed of 25 knots</strong> (cca 12 m/s) through the whole year.  The lagoon is about 20 km outside the city and kitesurfing community recognized the potential, so it became a tiny village mainly with many kite schools and cool places where other adventurers hang around. It\'s such a cool vibe and nice people around, so if you\'re visiting Phan Rang because of kitesurfing, then we definitely recommend this place!  My Hoa Lagoon becomes the best place to kitesurf during the high season (<strong>November to April</strong>) since the weather is sunny and temperatures average at 30ºC. There are days with light wind, but still, the speed is <strong>not getting below 15 knots</strong> (cca 8 m/s) which is still ideal for a nice session (+beginner friendly).  During some days, wind speed can reach a <strong>whopping 40 knots</strong> (around 20 m/s) which will give you some serious fun in the water!  The lagoon is highly affected by tides while coral reefs surround the lagoon. During the worst tide periods, you\'ll have to walk a few hundred meters to reach the water. Be careful when kitesurfing on low tides since you\'ll be surrounded by rocks and coral reefs. Plan it out beforehand and arm yourself with proper equipment.  During the high tides, you\'ll be gifted by shallow and calm water with a sandy ground. <h2><strong>Ninh Chu Bay</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4280\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.ninh-chu-bay.jpg\" alt=\"Ninh Chu Bay\" width=\"1161\" height=\"644\" />  This bay is the ideal spot for kitesurfing during the low season (<strong>March to September</strong>). Although the wind is a bit weaker, still, the average <strong>speed reaches 17 knots</strong> (8 m/s). During the most afternoons, windspeed <strong>reaches stable 25 knots</strong> (12 m/s).  Low season is known for a different direction of the wind that blows from the south in the morning. During afternoons, the wind tends to shift its direction from south to the southeast which gives stronger and stable wind.  Did you know that Ninh Chau Bay hosted the huge competition back in 2016. getting the biggest names in kitesurfing on these waters? The competition was called Kiteboard Tour Asia and it hosted about 100 competitors doing freestyle and racing on the winds.  <em><strong>Here\'s a stunning video from Kiteboard Tour Asia in Phan Rang:</strong></em>  https://vimeo.com/169704865  Ninh Chau is a huge chunk of sandy beach, so if the winds aren\'t in your favor, you should move a bit south until you find the perfect winds. Also, the water conditions are close to perfect. Shallow and calm water is perfect for beginners and also, you won\'t reach deep waters in the first 100 meters. <h2><strong>Main Phan Rang Beach</strong></h2> This beach is often used for swimming and relaxing, but still, the winds there are pretty solid and consistent throughout the whole year. Although the winds are a bit weaker than in the two locations above, still you can expect an <strong>average 15 knots</strong> during high season, and about 20 knots during low season. <h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>How to Get to Phan Rang</strong></h1> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4281\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.pristine-sea-in-Phan-Rang.jpg\" alt=\"Pristine sea in Phan Rang\" width=\"967\" height=\"641\" />  Phan Rang is the quiet city with a chilled vibe not discovered by mass tourism, YET. The place has the ideal location and is it sits on a triangle between Da Lat, Nha Trang, and Mui Ne; all three major touristic destinations.  <em>You don\'t have to worry about getting to Phan Rang since there are few convenient options:</em> <h2><strong>By Bus</strong></h2> The bus can easily be the most convenient way to travel around Vietnam, but when it comes to reaching small, non-touristic destinations like Phan Rang, the bus drive can become a nightmare in a blink of the eye.  Anyway, Phan Rang does have a bus station that sits on the infamous QL1. The exact location is <strong>between QL27 and Truong Dinh Street</strong>. Have in mind that the bus lines are very limited, so it\'s advisable to plan ahead. There are many taxi drivers who are waiting in front of the bus station, but be aware of the scams! Always bargain and have the map open!  <em>The most famous bus routes to and from Phan Rang:</em>  <strong>HCMC:</strong> Daily departure from 4am - 10am (150,000 VND)  <strong>Nha Trang:</strong> Daily departure from 6am - 3pm (70,000 VND)  <strong>Phan Thiet:</strong> Daily departure from 6am - 1pm (70,000 VND)  <strong>Da Nang:</strong> Daily departure at 4 pm (sleeping bus, 200,000 VND)  <strong>Hue:</strong> Daily departure at 4 pm (sleeping bus, 250,000 VND)  <strong>Vung Tau:</strong> Daily departure at 8:15 am (140,000 VND)  <strong>Buon Ma Thuot:</strong> Daily departure at 6 am (sitting bus, 110,000 VND) and 8:30 pm (sleeping bus, 150,000 VND)  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> Keep in mind that you can basically drop off from any bus that is passing Phan Rang. Just kindly ask a driver to drop you off near the bus station! </div> <h2><strong>By Train</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4282\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.train-to-phan-rang.jpg\" alt=\"Heading to Phan Rang by train\" width=\"1149\" height=\"640\" />  Luckily, for travelers who explore the country by train, Phan Rang is located on the main railway route that connects North to South. The name of the train station is <strong>Thap Cham</strong>. Many travelers who\'re traveling from North (Da Nang) or South (Saigon) pick this option as it provides you with stunning views through beautiful mountain passes, sandy dunes, rice fields, and ocean.  If you\'re a type of person who loves options (who isn\'t?), then you will definitely like this information - there are 4 different options to choose from!  For instance, people traveling <strong>from Saigon can expect a 5 - 7 hours drive</strong>, depending on the train company and number of stops.  <a href=\"https://www.seat61.com/Vietnam.htm\"><strong>Here you can check the train tickets and available options!</strong></a>  <em>As we already mentioned, there are four different options:</em> <ol>   <li><strong>a regular hard seat</strong> - skip this one since you\'ll be sitting on a wooden bench and it\'s pretty tough to do it for 7 hours. It\'s not worth a few dollars you\'re going to save.</li>   <li><strong>a regular soft seat</strong> - that is the best bang for the buck since the seats are pretty comfortable and reminds of European trains. Also, you can adjust the seats so the sleeping is possible.</li>   <li><strong>hard bed in 6 bunks cabin</strong> - a thin and comfortable mattress shared with 5 other people. It\'s extremely comfortable and makes your journey easier.</li>   <li><strong>hard bed in 4 bunks cabin</strong> - same as the option above, but you\'re sharing it with 3 other people.</li> </ol> The price depends on the option and company you choose, but usually, it ranges<strong> from 15$ to hard seat to $40 for 4-bunk hard bed</strong>.  Once you arrive at the train station, depending on the place you\'re staying, the taxi price to Ninh Chu Beach is around <strong>170,000 VND</strong>. You can always bargain a bit, and don\'t forget to use a GPS while driving in a taxi!  <strong>Don\'t want to get scammed in Vietnam? </strong><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam\"><strong>Here are the 36 most common scams you can experience in Vietnam!</strong></a> <h2><strong>By Plane</strong></h2> Most travelers set their foot to Vietnam via three major international airports - Hanoi, Da Nang or Saigon. Either airport you choose, you can get a connecting domestic flight to the <strong>nearest airport in Cam Ranh</strong> (<strong>about 1-hour drive from Phan Rang</strong>).  Cam Ranh airport is sometimes listed as Nha Trang, so be careful to ask for the information to not miss the flight or even a place. Once you landed at the airport, there will be a handful of taxi drivers offering you a drive. The whole drive is about 1 hour and it costs around <strong>700,000 VND</strong>.  Another, more convenient option is to hire a shuttle or private driver. It\'s a bit more costly if you\'re an individual, but for people who\'re traveling in the pack, this might be the perfect option! <h2><strong>By Motorbike/Road</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4283\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.phan-rang-by-motorbike.jpg\" alt=\"On the way to Phan Rang\" width=\"987\" height=\"740\" />  <em>Many adventurers decide to explore the beauty of Vietnam by riding a motorbike. If you\'re one of them then you have three main routes to reach Phan Rang:</em> <ol>   <li><strong>Nha Trang (north):</strong> If you\'re driving from Nha Trang, there are few roads you can take. A less scenic, more dangerous and faster QL1 is one option. The second option is driving from Nha Trang to Cam Rang taking a scenic coastal <strong>DT6571</strong>, and then taking a <strong>short QL1 drive until DT702</strong> which will provide you with stunning views and will lead you all the way to Phan Rang. The whole route is from 100 - 130 km long (depending on the route you take) and it will take you up to three hours.</li>   <li><strong>Da Lat (west):</strong> If you\'re starting from Da Lat, just take <strong>QL20 that will eventually become QL27</strong> and you will get directly to Phan Rang. The whole route is 110 km and it takes about three hours to complete.</li>   <li><strong>Mui Ne (south):</strong> From Mui Ne take <strong>DT716, then DT716B that will eventually connect to QL1</strong>. Be careful with DT716 since the police blockade is usually stopping tourists at DT716 between red and white sand dunes. There is a detour you can do to avoid the blockade and it\'s highly advisable to go around. The whole route is about 130 km and it takes around 3 hours to arrive at Phan Rang.</li> </ol> <strong>Interested in exploring Vietnam by motorbike? <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/hanoi-to-saigon\">Check out our detailed motorbike experience around Vietnam!</a></strong>  <img class=\"size-full wp-image-4278\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.mui-ne.jpg\" alt=\"Detour around Mui Ne corrupt police\" width=\"574\" height=\"498\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Instead of taking DT716, head over to Phan Thiet and take DT715 instead. That way, you will avoid corrupt police around white and red sand dunes.</div> <h2><strong>Getting Around Phan Rang</strong></h2> The most convenient option to explore this chilled place is by driving a motorbike. There are few scenic routes outside the town along with many natural wonders around. Also, the coastal road is around so what could be better than renting a motorbike?  The prices for daily rental for scooter/semi-automatic <strong>starts at 100,000 VND/day</strong>. There are some places where you can rent bigger motorbikes like Honda CRF150 that are suitable for offroad drives.  <em>If you\'re not confident in your driving skills, you can always count on taxies and local drivers:</em>  <strong>Mai Linh:</strong> (068) 3898 989  <strong>Sun Taxi:</strong> (068) 385 8585  <strong>Taxi Asia:</strong> (068) 3535 3535  <hr /> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Is there anything more you\'d like to know about kitesurfing in Phan Rang?

(12719, 3, '2019-03-26 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'Nha Trang is without the doubt one of the most attractive beach city in Vietnam. The chances are when you\'re talking with someone about  Nha Trang you will hear <strong><em>\'Don\'t go there, it\'s filled with Russians!\'</em></strong>. We heard it many times, but we always explore places and experience things despite negative experiences and perspectives of other people.  We do admit that almost every place has the menu on Russian and Vietnamese which is a great sign what\'s going on there. Also, there are many Russian tourists around, it\'s a fact, but not enough to skip this beautiful place!  <em><strong>Did you know that Nha Trang and its surrounding islands lie on coral reefs where marine life is so alive and diverse that it\'s hard to believe you\'re in Vietnamese waters?</strong></em>  When you have a combination of crystal clear waters and coral reef, the first thing that comes to our mind is dipping in a new adventure - snorkeling in Nha Trang and surrounding islands!  If you don\'t like the busy bustle of the city, that\'s fine, head over to calm and clear waters of the surrounding area.  <em>Let\'s talk more about Nha Trang snorkeling and why it\'s so special!</em> <h2><strong>When is the Best Time for Snorkeling in Nha Trang?</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4330\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.snorkeling-in-nha-trang.jpg\" alt=\"Snorkeling in clear waters\" width=\"1044\" height=\"668\" />  Nha Trang is located on the southern coast of Vietnam which means the city goes through two main seasons - low and high season. The weather and especially snorkeling conditions hugely depend on the season you\'re visiting Nha Trang.  The best snorkeling months in Nha Trang are without any questions - <strong>April to October</strong>. If you have a chance to visit during July or August, you\'ll be greeted with amazing sunny weather, combined with a bit of wind and extremely good visibility in the water. On a good day during the peak season, you can e<strong>xpect visibility of 15 - 20 meters which is crazy good</strong>!  The worst time to do snorkeling is definitely <strong>between December to the beginning of March</strong>. There are still some tours operating and you might be able to hop on a tour, but don\'t expect great water conditions and visibility.  <div data-gyg-href=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/default/activites.frame\" data-gyg-locale-code=\"en-US\" data-gyg-widget=\"activities\" data-gyg-number-of-items=\"3\" data-gyg-currency=\"EUR\" data-gyg-partner-id=\"781AB6P\" data-gyg-q=\"nha trang snorkeling\"></div> <script async defer src=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js\"></script>  Anyway, the sea around Nha Trang is extremely diverse, so while snorkeling you can expect to see all kind of interesting sea creatures including putter fish, butterfly fish, moray eels and beautiful corals all around you! Don\'t have the expectation of stumbling upon sharks, turtles or rays in these waters! We must say that for some people it\'s a disappointment, while for some a huge relief (Lovel knows what are we talking about here)!  <strong>Thinking of <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/phan-rang-kitesurfing\">kitesurfing in Phan Rang</a> which is just 2 hours from Nha Trang?</strong>  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> <strong>Best time to go:</strong> Anywhere between April and October. July and August are the best months to be around!  <strong>Worst time to go:</strong> From mid-December to the beginning of March!</div> <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Snorkeling Sites for Unforgettable Experience</strong></h2> Luckily, snorkeling sites in Nha Trang are extremely close to the city and there are many tours operating in the area, so if you\'re looking to snorkel in clear waters with diverse marine life, the high possibility is that you\'re heading to Hon Mun marine protected area. During the peak season, this snorkeling site becomes filled with tourists and boats which still makes a good experience.  <em>The only problem is that we\'re talking about protected maritime area, but the flocks of boats and littering that goes with it make it a bit questionable.</em> <h3><strong>Hon Ong or Whale Island</strong></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4340\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Hon-Ong.jpg\" alt=\"Hon Ong island\" width=\"968\" height=\"640\" />  When it comes to snorkeling in Nha Trang, the majority of people experience a stunning Hon Mun Marine Area and surrounding islands, but not so many people go a bit north from the city to stunning Whale Island or Hon Ong. The island is located a bit outside the city, about <strong>100 km northern</strong> and it\'s a quiet escape from all the bustle and noise of the city.  The island sits at Van Phong Bay and it provides its visitors with turquoise waters and untouched nature. There are few resorts where you can relax while enjoying the island vibe.  <iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d7785.937838914125!2d109.39448484577684!3d12.650042532521635!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x3170053efe2180e3%3A0xe8b178bafd55f14d!2sHon+Ong!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1553488198411\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe> Snorkeling along with many other water activities like diving and kayaking is very popular around the waters of the island. The good thing is that the waters aren\'t filled with flocks of boats and tours since we couldn\'t find any tour that goes directly from Nha Trang.  There are few tours, especially from resorts who are organizing snorkeling on Whale Island and it usually costs about <strong>60 - 100k VND per day</strong>. <h3><strong>Hon Mun</strong></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4341\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Hon-Mun.jpg\" alt=\"Hon Mun island\" width=\"1131\" height=\"601\" />  Located in a protected marine area just <strong>45 minutes away from the city by boat</strong>, Hon Mun is the most popular snorkeling site in Nha Trang. There are countless tour companies operating in the waters, so you can choose between so many options.  In a protected area, there are at least <strong>300 different kinds of corals and more than a thousand species of fish</strong>. You can stumble upon moray eel, butterfly fish, putter fish and many others. If you\'re looking to swim with reef sharks or rays, don\'t expect it since there are not residing in these waters.  <iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3900.2092854997795!2d109.30028835045454!3d12.166150135288042!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x317063b8a9c9e44b%3A0xc6f470ef9527e3ce!2sHon+Mun+Marine+Protected+Area!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1553488231270\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe> The waters are very clear and you can even see the bottom from the boat. The coral reef is so colorful and lively which will provide you with an amazing experience! Listen to your instructor since the waters there are a bit deeper than usual, ranging <strong>from 10 - 25 meters</strong>! <h3><strong>Hon Lao or Monkey Island</strong></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4342\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Hon-Lao.jpg\" alt=\"Hon Lao island\" width=\"975\" height=\"642\" />  A bit underrated island located just off the coast of Nha Trang in Nha Phu lagoon is the perfect spot for snorkeling! The island is usually called Monkey island since it\'s a <strong>natural habitat to more than 1,000 monkeys</strong>. Many travelers choose this one for snorkeling because <strong>not so deep waters (3 - 5 meters)</strong>, a very clear sea and so colorful coral reefs with all kind of sea life living around. It\'s such a stunning place to go snorkeling! <iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3897.340350701974!2d109.21219640045574!3d12.36011918130125!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x31706993797c9a83%3A0xa74ecc401f50f0e0!2zaMOybiBMYW8!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1553488254239\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe> <h2><strong>Amazing Snorkeling Tour in Nha Trang with Vietnam Active</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4331\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.hon-mun-island.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnam Active in Hon Mun island\" width=\"981\" height=\"795\" />  Nha Trang is a very popular and world-wide recognized place for water activities. The reason is a beautiful coast with many islands and peninsulas around that are surrounded by coral reef and crystal clear waters. It\'s not a surprise that there are countless tour companies that offer diving or snorkeling activities.  We can recommend a very professional and passionate company that operates in Nha Trang called <strong>Vietnam Active</strong>. They have an office in Nha Trang and offer all kind of adventure water activities including scuba diving, free diving and snorkeling.  If you decide to go on tour with this company, expect waking up early since they <strong>start picking up people around the city at 7 am</strong>. The final destination is Hon Hun Marine Park that is about 45 minutes away by boat from the harbor.  They usually change the snorkeling sites depending on the weather conditions and visibility, but in total, you can expect to visit two snorkeling sites.  At the first site on the eastern side of the island, expect to <strong>spend about 1.5 hours of snorkeling</strong>. Even if you\'re not experienced or outside the form, don\'t worry as they have an instructor on the boat who can assist you in water, teach you a technique and give you valuable tips for snorkeling.  The great thing about this tour is that people have <strong>free drinks (coffee, tea, water) as well as a diverse lunch included</strong>. The lunch is usually a buffet with meat, cheese, eggs and vegetables which goes very good after a session of snorkeling.  After the lunch, the boat drives to another site which is about 15 minutes west from the first site where you jump in the crystal clear waters and enjoy the biodiversity of life in the sea.  You can expect to be <strong>back at your accommodation around 2 pm</strong>.  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> We\'re not affiliated by a tour company and we\'re not getting any money by promoting them.

If you have not and are planning to visit Vietnam then you should seriously consider including this awesome place to your travel itinerary.   There are a couple of good reasons why Ba Na Hills is so special. First of all, cable-car which takes you to this fantasy world holds a world record for being the </span>highest and longest non-stop cable-car in the WOLRD<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the views during the ride are absolutely stunning. Golden Bridge is a relatively recent addition to this fantasy and entertainment park but it has quickly earned the love of travelers due to its unique looks. The bridge which is seemingly made of gold is supported by two massive hands. For this reason, some even call it Gods Hands Bridge.  However, Ba Na Hills is not just about the cable-car ride to the bridge. There is a whole </span>fantasy and entertainment world<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> built high up in the mountains which is where all the fun happens. Visitors are free to enjoy a number of rides, video games, performances and other activities the coolest being a mountain cart ride.   You are in complete control in terms of how fast you go – just release the brakes and enjoy the </span>adrenaline and excitement<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> rushing into your body. Once you are done with the rides you can have a relaxing stroll around the French village or enjoy buffet lunch or dinner at the Beer Plaza.  <strong>p.s.</strong> Don\'t forget to read our <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/3-days-in-da-nang\"><strong>Da Nang itinerary</strong></a> where we included a visit to Ba Na Hills, surrounding waterfalls and much more.

But Hue is also home to a forgotten dragon.  Ho Thuy Tien is an <a href=\"https://horizonunknown.com/abandoned-water-park-vietnam/\">abandoned water theme park</a> that sits around a 20-minute drive from downtown </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hue. Being so close to a busy city you would think the neglected water park would see many adventure-seeking </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tourists – but that isn’t the case.  This dragon sits at one end of the small lake, on top of a building that once housed crocodiles. While the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">crocodiles have moved on, the dragon has been left to decay with graffiti-covered scales and broken </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">glass all around.  There are other things to see as you drive around the bumpy and derelict footpath. An auditorium is left in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ruins as weeds flourish and peeling paint from water slides give a lingering eerie vibe. To add to the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">random attraction, there’s a space simulator in one corner of the park.  Since its closure shortly after opening in 2004, Ho Thuy Tien is a unique place to visit and a memorable part of the ancient city of Hue.

A four-hour bus ride from My Dinh bus station in Hanoi, your first glimpse of this beautiful village will be at the stopover point on Thung Khe Pass where you can have a cup of green tea while munching on some grilled corn and sweet potato.  In Mai Chau, it is recommended to plan a homestay in one of the villages, Lac Village being the most popular, as it will be a great opportunity to observe rural life in Northern Vietnam. Rent a bicycle and take a relaxing ride through the area or head to the Pu Luong Nature Reserve, which is well-known for its stunning hiking trails and waterfalls. Visit Thac Bo Temple and the caves and grottos around the area.  While in Mai Chau, do what the locals do. Try cooking your rice in bamboo (Com Lam) and have it with a bit of wild boar. If you don\'t fancy any meat, then have it with their coconut and sesame topping. The fragrance of the bamboo and banana leaf makes eating rice a whole different experience.

There were so many mixed reviews talking about mice and cockroaches, loud and obnoxious people running up and down the corridors, and doors being opened in the middle of the night!  We booked a four-bed soft berth cabin for our family of 4 and we had an awesome experience. Catching the overnight train is definitely one of our best memories of traveling in Vietnam.   This is definitely not 5-star train travel though. I think if you are used to this you will need to lower your expectations – there is no dining car or private bathrooms, wifi or meals provided etc, and if you don’t book all four beds you will be sharing with strangers.   There are some items you should bring with you on your train trip in Vietnam. Bring your own snacks and breakfast (or you can buy noodles etc from the trolley carts), wipes, toilet paper and a silk sleeping bag. There was also drinking water at each end of the carriage, so just bring your water bottles.  Overall, we can highly recommend catching the overnight train in Vietnam as a great experience. From the rolling and rocking of the train to the awesome scenery it is a really great way to travel. <p style=\"text-align: left;\">This amazing experience was contributed by <a href=\"https://www.hilltribetravels.com/\">HillTribeTravels</a>.

The views from the cable car are absolutely incredible. You can look down and see the turquoise sea, green islands and fishing boats below. The water is so clear that you can literally see the shadows of the boats on the bottom of the ocean bed.  The beach at Pineapple Island is beautiful, although in my opinion no more so than Phu Quoc’s Long Beach and Bai Sao.

Driving through lush green fields overlooking Danang Bay it is clear to see where the pass gets its reputation.   Although the road is in excellent condition, the drivers should remain alert and rather stop more frequently to take in the views rather than trying to combine it with driving. Once you get used to the road and the turns, crossing Hai Van Pass on a motorbike becomes pure fun!  Thinking of traveling around Vietnam by motorbike?

Its picturesque seascape is decorated by over a thousand limestone karsts and islets. Declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994, what a better way to explore Ha Long Bay than to indulge yourself in a relaxing cruise?   Aboard a traditional, wooden boat, a full-day cruise would be enough for you to marvel in its impressive beauty. Fill your senses by just finding a nice spot at the boat’s deck. For the most part, you’ll cruise the waters. But your Ha Long Bay tour can be more interesting by visiting at least one of its</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">limestone caves and grottoes like Thien Cung, Dau Go, and Sung Sot.   These maybe some of the enchanting caves you’ll ever see because apart from showcasing astonishing stalactites and stalagmites, the caves are well maintained and even adorned with natural and artificial lights. <a href=\"https://travelhabeat.com/vietnam-ha-long-bay-full-day-cruise/\">Cruising Ha Long Bay</a> is really a refreshing, therapeutic escape from the busy streets of the city.

The imperial rulers used to enjoy large banquets that unfolded over hours, which required the development of a range of dishes to keep both the kings and their wives satisfied during the long affairs.  Using local produce, chefs developed smaller petite dishes, tasty vegetarian options, fiery soups, and seafood dishes from produce caught from the Perfume River, just to name a few.  However, trying to eat your way through the entire range original Hue food would be an impossible task in one visit, so here are a few “must-try” dishes for your visit.  Bun Bo Hue, probably the most well-known dish from Hue, is a beef noodle soup that is fiery and a mainstay breakfast dish for locals and tourists alike.  Want to know more about the culinary center of Vietnam? Head over to <a href=\"https://theroamingfork.com/hue-food-what-to-eat-in-hue/\">must-try food while traveling around Hue</a>!  Stalls selling Com Hen, a combination of rice, local clams, peanuts, and a mix of other ingredients, are everywhere, as are small restaurants dedicated to Nem Lui, sausages made from pork and cooked on lemongrass skewers, then wrapped in rice paper with an assortment of pickled vegetables and slices of the local green.  A few other dishes worth seeking out are Banh Khoa, the smaller and thicker version of the Vietnamese classic Banh Xeo, Banh Beo, the small rice flour cakes topped with dried shrimp and pork crackling, and the popular street food snacks of Banh Ep and Banh Trang Trung.  If your time is short, there is a well-known local restaurant called Hanh, that offers a set menu, giving diners a chance to experience many of the unique flavors and textures of Hue food.  Are you craving for some <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-street-food\"><strong>Vietnamese street food</strong></a>?

The art of water puppetry originated in the 11</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> century, in the villages of Northern Vietnam. These festivals were originally held by the villagers to entertain themselves when the rice fields would flood. The flooded rice paddies acted as the stage with the water being a symbolic link to the rice harvest.  Today, modern water puppetry is performed in a pool, where the water acts as the stage. The puppeteers stand behind a decorated split-bamboo screen and control the puppets using long bamboo rods. Water hides the puppet strings and puppeteer movements improve the musical and vocal acoustics and provides a shimmering lighting effect. The stories enacted are a reference to ancient Vietnamese folktales. Traditional musical instruments and songs accompany these shows.  The best place to experience this is Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre, located in Hanoi near the Hoan Kiem Lake. There are multiple shows throughout the day and ticket prices cost 100,000 VND. Because of the demand, it is better to book early especially to get a seat in the first few rows.Sit further away and you won’t be able to catch much of the action!   Additionally, you can buy puppets as souvenirs from the theatre as well as from nearby shops. This is definitely a must for your Vietnam trip.

Most tourists that visit Lao Cai head to the town of Sapa which sits above the beautiful Muong Hoa Valley.   Sapa is famous for its stunning landscape, vibrant handwoven textiles, and the local ethnic tribes; the H\'mong, Dai, and Dao. The highlight of your trip will be </span><a href=\"https://wanderingwheatleys.com/sapa-vietnam-trekking-guide/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">trekking in Sapa</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through steep terraced rice fields and waving to the people in these small villages while they tend to their crops or go about their daily chores.   If you really want to get a feel for the local life, make sure you spend at least one night at a homestay in one of the quaint villages. You\'ll be treated to dinner by the host family and probably wind up drinking more than a few shots of homemade rice wine.    No trip to Sapa is complete without taking a ride on the cable car to the top of Fansipan Mountain, the highest peak in Southeast Asia. From the top of the mountain, you\'ll be able to look north across the patchwork of rice fields in the valley stretching all the way to China!

Its followers promote peace, unity and tolerance and believe that all religions are essentially the same.  A mix of Asian and Western influences can be seen in religion. Its saints include Sun Yat Sen, Julius Caesar and Victor Hugo. Like many Buddhists in Vietnam, Caodai followers practice at least </span><a href=\"https://www.thenomadicvegan.com/vegan-vietnam-tour-package/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">part-time vegetarianism</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  The Great Divine Temple, which is the main temple of the Cao Dai faith, lies about 90 kilometers from Ho Chi Minh City and can be visited on a day trip.  Ceremonies involving chanting, music, prayer and incense burning are held four times a day, at 6 am, noon, 6 pm and midnight. Visitors are welcome to watch and take photos from the upstairs galleries. You must wear long pants or a skirt that covers your knees.  The temple is rich in symbolism, the most important symbol is the Divine Eye. Priests dress in red, blue or yellow gowns, while followers dress in white gowns.

By nightfall, the river is full of hundreds of lantern-strewn boats and colorful floating lanterns, twinkling in the distance.   The riverside can be a bit chaotic in the evening, with thousands of visitors and vendors vying for your attention, so for a more peaceful experience, I recommend floating down the river, past the revelry, in a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sampan </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">boat, to admire the lights and the scenery from afar.  For more travel inspiration check out <a href=\"https://uprootedtraveler.com/\">Uprootedtraveler - a travel blog for vegans</a>.   If you don’t happen to be in town during the full moon, not to worry- Hoi An’s lanterns are so popular that you can find them twinkling along the riverfront on pretty much any given night.   If floating lanterns aren’t your thing, I’d recommend alternatively celebrating the full moon by a nearby pagoda, where monks hold candlelit ceremonies in the evening, perfumed by incense and the sweet night air. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">    This amazing experience was contributed by Jessica from <a href=\"https://www.uprootedtraveler.com\">Uprootedtraveler</a>.

If you don’t have so much time it’s okay to just go there for an evening.  In Vietnam, there are many English coffee shops where students go to improve their English. For foreigners, it’s an amazing opportunity to meet locals and learn more about Vietnamese culture.  Right on the first day, I was invited by a local tour guide for Vietnamese people who wanted to improve his English. He showed me hidden places in Da Nang and its surrounding area.  Almost every day I met new amazing people who invited me to hang out with them. It gave me the opportunity to learn a lot about the Vietnamese culture, its lovely people and how they live.  In 2 weeks I had a chance to try delicious local dishes, explore the most beautiful spots around Da Nang, how to drive a motorbike, singing karaoke and even got invited to a Vietnamese wedding.

Once you\'re done exploring or getting bored in Da Nang, head to Son Tra Peninsula that features wide windy roads, pagodas, hidden beaches, hiking trails, and breathtaking viewpoints! The peninsula sits just a few kilometers from the city center, and it\'s a perfect getaway if you are looking for a relaxing day filled with activities and adventure!  No matter where you\'re staying in Da Nang, the chances are you\'ll always see a beautiful white Buddha statue overlooking the city from the peninsula. Although Son Tra Peninsula is a massive area with many hidden treasures, the majority of travelers just scratch a few stunning places around while not knowing about other secret places.  I\'ve been living in Da Nang for the past 14 months and had a chance to thoroughly explore every corner of Son Tra Peninsula or how tourists like to call it; Monkey Mountain. <h2><strong>How to Get to Son Tra Peninsula (Scooters Prohibited)</strong></h2> Getting to the peninsula is pretty straightforward. You need to <strong>reach the main beach (My Khe), </strong>and from there, it\'s hard not to notice a massive white Lady Buddha statue. Basically, just follow the main beach road in the north direction (<strong>Vo Nguyen Giap that turns into Hoang Sa as you drive north</strong>).  The best way to explore Son Tra is by <strong>driving a manual/semi-auto motorbike</strong>. If you\'re not feeling comfortable to drive in Vietnam, you can always book a motorbike tour with professional tour guides who will show you beautiful and hidden spots. Anyway, by choosing to book a tour you\'re losing quite a lot of freedom as the driver has to follow the schedule, and by doing it, you\'ll probably miss many off-the-beaten-track places. Many backpackers in the city are exploring Son Tra, so connect with them in hostels or Facebook groups and figure out together the best solutions.  Renting a motorbike in Da Nang is very affordable, and it costs <strong>around 100,000 VND for a scooter for a whole day</strong>. <del>I suggest getting a manual or semi-automatic bike since some roads are very steep, and you might experience a tough time to get your scooter up there, especially if you\'re two on the bike!</del>  <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>UPDATE November 2019: <a href=\"https://e.vnexpress.net/news/travel/places/da-nang-prohibits-scooters-on-peninsula-following-spate-of-accidents-3997623.html\">Automatic scooters are prohibited</a></strong> to go to Son Tra Peninsula since there were many fatal accidents due to brake failure. Currently, you can\'t get to Son Tra without a permit that you can get at one of three security gates (free of cost). Visitors can enjoy Son Tra from 7:30 am to 7 pm daily.</span>  If you\'re looking to get your bike, there are things you should look at when <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam\">buying a motorbike in Vietnam</a>, so if you don\'t have any mechanic skills, be careful! <div data-gyg-href=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/default/activites.frame\" data-gyg-locale-code=\"en-US\" data-gyg-widget=\"activities\" data-gyg-number-of-items=\"3\" data-gyg-currency=\"EUR\" data-gyg-partner-id=\"781AB6P\" data-gyg-q=\"son tra\"></div> <script async defer src=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js\"></script> <h2><strong>Man Thai Village</strong></h2> <p id=\"wjWGKbF\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5545 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dd79e785491e.jpg\" alt=\"Man Thai Village, Da Nang\" width=\"998\" height=\"742\" /></p> Just at the beginning of Son Tra, there is a tiny fishermen village called Man Thai. A few years back, it was an authentic fishermen village, but now, due to <a href=\"https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/geowissenschaften/arbeitsgruppen/geographie/forschungsbereich/geoinformatik-gis/arbeitsgruppe/aktuelle-projekte/rapid-planning/example-urbanization-danang/\">rapid development</a>, it is another part of the city. If you follow the beach road Hoang Sa in the direction of Son Tra, you will see a colorful fleet of coracle boats anchored in a tiny bay. The best way to experience the lifestyle of locals is by <strong>getting there around 6 am</strong>. At that time, the village is so lively and vibrant as locals sell fresh seafood and prepare the boats for the sea.  Every time, it amazes me how active Vietnamese people are. On the way there, you will stumble upon older and younger people running, doing a morning workout, stretching, and dancing a funny dance called Duong Sinh.  <strong>Expats in Da Nang: </strong>Looking to relocate and start a new life in Da Nang. Read our <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/living-in-da-nang\">cost breakdown of living in Da Nang</a>.  Few places sell morning snacks like Banh Mi and a <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide\">strong cup of Vietnamese coffee</a>. Also, on the beach, you can sit in a beach chair while enjoying your morning snack and watching the sunrise. That\'s my favorite way to start my morning! <h2><strong>Green Lake</strong></h2> From Man Thai village, people usually head straight to Linh Ung pagoda, completely missing a stunning lake on the way - Green Lake. Once you\'re on the road to Linh Ung pagoda and when the road slowly starts to ascend, one the left-hand-side, you\'ll be greeted with the views of the stunning lake. Just park your motorbike there (few people will be there, and you can securely leave the bike for 10,000 VND or just go to the lake with your bike), and you are ready for exploration.  During March - June, the water is crystal clear, and the lake looks green since the bottom has much grass, which is a natural habitat for many fish species! There are few places where you can jump and swim, as well as a small campsite where you can raise a tent to finish off your adventure!  <em>Did you know that almost every wedding photo session isn\'t complete without a shot at Green Lake?</em>  Don\'t miss it! Especially not on a hot day where the lake will provide you with the best refreshment you can think of! <h2><strong>Linh Ung Pagoda</strong></h2> <p id=\"xfWiEvu\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5544 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dd79e0f5758a.jpg\" alt=\"Linh Ung Pagoda Son Tra Peninsula\" width=\"995\" height=\"743\" /></p> Once you\'re done with swimming and taking stunning photos at Green Lake, it\'s time to visit famous Linh Ung pagoda! That place is by far the most-visited attraction on the peninsula, so be very strategic about your arrival. Go there just <strong>after the sunrise since there are not many tourists around, and you can experience Buddhist prayers and rituals</strong>. The worst time is definitely around 11 am - 6 pm!  Avoid full-moon days and other holidays as locals flock there, and it can be tough to even walk around without bumping into people!  The place is the complex of a few pagodas and temples where people pray and perform rituals. Also, <strong>Lady Buddha that is 67 meters tall</strong> stays in the middle of the complex, protecting Da Nang from wind and storms. Just walking around the complex will provide you with some stunning views over the city.  <strong>Plan your itinerary: </strong>Check out our <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/3-days-in-da-nang\">72 hours Da Nang itinerary</a> and have fun.  An interesting fact is that local fishermen built lady Buddha statue as they believed her presence protects them and gives them luck when they head to the sea.  <em><strong>The entrance is free of charge, and you can leave a donation in the parking zone.</strong></em>  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> As it\'s a Buddhist temple, be sure that you have some level of respect by wearing long pants and sleeves. Vietnamese people aren\'t rigorous when it comes to clothing compared to Thailand or Myanmar. Just cover your knees and shoulders, and you\'ll be fine.</div> <h2><strong>Secret Beach #1</strong></h2> <p id=\"PoYNxvS\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5543 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dd79d07a95d3.jpg\" alt=\"Secluded sandy beach on Son Tra\" width=\"1169\" height=\"707\" /></p> Once you continue driving from Linh Ung pagoda further, you will reach a hut with small and improvised parking. There is a woman who asks <strong>10,000 VND during the day and 35,000 VND during the night</strong> to take care of your bike. From the parking spot, just follow the narrow path that leads to the secluded beach.  Friendly locals who\'re camping or drinking, spend their afternoons at the beach. During the day, the only people you\'ll see are few fishermen who\'re catching the fish from the rocks around (very impressive to observe the dedication and patience of these people).  <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>UPDATE November 2019: </strong>Last time when I went there, my mirrors from the bike were stolen in front of the women. When we explained the situation, she became very aggressive as she was trying to prove we\'ve arrived without the mirrors. We showed her our GoPro footage, but she disagreed and called us \'filthy tourists\'. Also, she charges for beach maintenance, which is fine, but once you arrive at the beach, you\'ll be greeted with vast and smelly piles of trash everywhere. </span> <h2><strong>Bai Da</strong></h2> <em>By this time, you might feel a bit hungry and in need to refill your energy. What would be the better way than enjoying the local seafood on the beach in a small hut overlooking Da Nang?</em>  Bai Da is the ideal spot for that! If you continue to drive further from Bai Nam beach, you will reach a parking spot where you can park (free) while enjoying local delicacies. There is a small beach with rocks and a few human-made bridges connecting the rocks. It\'s a perfect way to spend your afternoon before heading to the next location! <h2><strong>Ghenh Bang</strong></h2> Once you\'re back on the main road, just continue heading east, and you\'ll be greeted by the most stunning views Son Tra peninsula has to offer! There is a stunning pass overlooking the outer part of the peninsula while giving you breathtaking views of the open sea.  You can park your bike there, sit a bit and relax on the cliffs! The views are really spectacular.  If you continue a bit further, you will stumble upon a <strong>small parking lot where taxi drivers park their cars</strong>. Go there and park your bike (no cost). There is a short and ascending hiking trail that leads you to the rocky beach. You will need to pass through some trees, so be sure to have long sleeves and proper shoes as it gets slippery on some parts.  After 20 minutes, you\'ll reach Ghenh Banh - a small and secluded beach featuring stunning rocks and colorful underwater life. You can swim and snorkel!  Climbing up is relatively easy compared to going down, and once you reach the parking lot, you can sit and order a traditional Vietnamese coffee or tea and enjoy the passion of taxi drivers while playing a card game. <h2><strong>Banyan Tree</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4465\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.banyan-tree-son-tra.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful Banyan Tree\" width=\"970\" height=\"641\" />  Once you\'re done with your hike to Ghenh Banh and back on the road, after a minute, you\'ll reach the next crossroad. Take the right turn and just follow the rarely marked trail. It\'s a very narrow road that goes further up the mountain. The condition of the road isn\'t the best and there is always some traffic, so be careful when driving as there were few accidents reported recently.  After a few minutes, there will be a small fork where you take the right turn (it\'s marked). Just follow the road, and you\'ll reach a Banyan tree that is said to be <strong>around 1,000 years old</strong>. That area is the natural habitat of endangered monkey species called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-shanked_douc\">Red Shanked Douc</a>. That species live around Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, but <strong>most of them (around 200) lives in the forest of Son Tra Peninsula</strong>.  Although, you have to be very lucky to see that beautiful monkey around it. When we were exploring Monkey Mountain, we only heard them, but never saw them.  The diameter of the tree is around 20 meters, and some branches connect to the ground as it serves as the root. It\'s very amazing just to take a seat and experience this beautiful creation of Mother Earth. You can park the bike on the road free of any cost.  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> The tree has a historical value as, during the Vietnam war (or how locals call it, an American war), Vietnamese soldiers used the tree as the shelter.</div> <h2><strong>Mui Nghe</strong></h2> <p id=\"UQhOqqr\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5542 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dd79c40155df.jpg\" alt=\"Mui Nghe\" width=\"1168\" height=\"872\" /></p> Once you\'re done wandering around a Banyan tree, just continue driving on the road until you reach a dead end. You park the motorbike there, and from there, you\'ll see a small path through the jungle. Be ready for <strong>about 30-minutes hike</strong> that leads to the end of Son Tra peninsula - Mui Nghe.  The literal translation of the name is a<em> \'Horn of the Buffalo\'.</em> There is a very cool place where you can set a campsite and enjoy the sunrise and stunning sunset falling over Da Nang city. If you continue your hike, you will eventually get to the sea where you can swim and snorkel. The water made a small lake between the cliffs where you can swim in cold and turquoise waters.  Be careful, though, as we saw many jellyfish in the \'lake\'! <h2><strong>Tien Sa Lighthouse</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4475 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.tien-sa-lighthouse.jpg\" alt=\"Son Tra Peninsula Tien Sa Lighthouse\" width=\"1192\" height=\"785\" />  On the northeast part of Son Tra, there is a tiny Tien Sa lighthouse. The lighthouse is only 16 meters tall, and it helps in navigating the boat traffic between Hue city to Da Nang port. Once you reach the lighthouse there will be a security guy who requests <strong>20,000 VND for climbing the lighthouse</strong> and get panorama view over the sea and mountains of Son Tra.  It\'s relatively easy to reach the lighthouse if you follow the main Hoang Sa road. The way is the same as you\'re going to the Banyan tree, but at the fork (you\'ve turned right to reach Banyan tree), just continue driving. <h2><strong>Bai Cat Vang Beach</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4457\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Bai-Cat-Vang.jpg\" alt=\"Bai Cat Vang beach\" width=\"1425\" height=\"683\" />  Now when you have so many places and information on how to reach those places on the eastern part of the Son Tra peninsula, it\'s time to explore the western part - a more secluded part featuring secluded beaches.  Bai Cat Vang is the first off-the-beaten-path beach on the way. Park your motorbike at the beginning of a narrow path and walk for about 5 minutes until you reach a small beach hidden in a bay. It\'s a sandy beach with a few rocks where you can chill or even set up your tent.  While we were there, we stumbled upon local fishermen who were coming from the sea. Also, you can enjoy snorkeling or swimming in crystal clear waters in a tiny bay.  As tourism is booming in the city, it takes effect on Son Tra too. Bai Cat Vang has a local resort that looks empty during offseason, but as locals say, it becomes hectic during the season (April - September). We went there in March, and we stumbled upon a few local families with kids. During the summer, there are many activities you can take part in, like <strong>snorkeling, kayaking, scuba diving, building a campsite with a massive fire, and much more</strong>  When planning your trip to Da Nang, be sure to take the season in a planning process. Read about the <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/best-time-to-visit-da-nang\">best seasons to visit Da Nang</a> and have the best possible time. <h2><strong>Bai Da Den </strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4458\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Bai-Da-Den-.jpg\" alt=\"Bai Da Den\" width=\"1185\" height=\"827\" />  When you\'re done with exploring Bai Cat Vang beach, you should follow a tiny path towards your bike. When you pick the motorcycle, just continue about 100 meters further, and you will reach a small parking spot where you can leave the bike. From there, you will notice a small and narrow path going down to the Bai Da Den beach.  The beach is rocky, and many cliffs make it ideal for snorkeling or kayaking. Also, there is a camping spot just on the cliffs that gives you beautiful views so far away from the bustle of the busy Da Nang city.  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> Whenever we visited the place, we always stumbled upon friendly locals who were camping. The biggest problem with camping there is that locals aren\'t aware so much about the littering, so they leave every piece of trash behind them. Please don\'t do it!</div> <h2><strong>Ban Co Peak</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5541 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dd79b99501a9.jpg\" alt=\"Ban Co Peak Son Tra Peninsula\" width=\"1173\" height=\"873\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Ban Co Peak is the highest point of Son Tra Peninsula and it provides people with stunning views over the whole city.</div>  Situated in the middle of the Son Tra Peninsula, Ban Co is the tallest peak of the peninsula where you\'ll be greeted with stunning views over the jungle on one side and a whole city on the other side. As the summit is 693 meters above sea level, the clouds are cutting through it, which gives you an incredible experience and feeling that you\'re literally in the clouds.  Once you reach the peak, you can park your motorbike on the <strong>parking lot that costs 5,000 VND/bike, </strong>and from there, you have to climb a bit to reach the top. Also, at the parking spot, you can order cold drinks like tea or coffee, but the best is to bring some fruits or beverages with you (some people enjoy a picnic there).  The views are breathtaking, but you should time your trip since it\'s a very touristic place and crowds can kill the vibe. Arguably, the best time to visit Ban Co is around the sunrise.  At the top, there is a De Thich statue in front of the chessboard. Interestingly, De Thich is playing by himself. A <a href=\"https://english.thesaigontimes.vn/42085/Huge-chess-board-on-top-of-Son-Tra-Mountain.html\">legend goes</a> that he was playing with another deity while he flew down to the beach as he was distracted by beautiful fairies. He lost the game, and out of anger, kicked the chessboard to the sea. People made the statue in a credit of another deity who was waiting for him and planning the next move.  <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>UPDATE November 2019: </strong>Last time when we climbed to Ban Co peak, they\'ve furnished the trail to the top. Right now, you have concrete stairs that make a final climb accessible to anyone. </span>  <hr /> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Have you ever explored Son Tra Peninsula?

South East Asia is slowly becoming the major hub of digital nomads, so Vietnam is getting on that list pretty fast. Da Nang is one of the most developed coastal cities in central Vietnam that is known for a small, but a fast-growing community of digital nomads.  The city is very clean, people are relaxed, the beach is just next to the city center, the infrastructure is great, the international airport is just in the city center and the internet is fast! What more to ask for as a digital nomad looking for a place to be productive?  There are many cafes popping up each day that are suitable for the work - delicious Vietnamese coffee, ergonomic seats and fast internet (also, the staff doesn\'t mind if you stay there for few hours!). Although there are few coworking spaces in Da Nang where you can buy passes and work in the specifically designed office, we prefer working in small and cozy local cafes.  <strong><em>When working on this list of the best cafe places in Da Nang to make your work done, we had in mind the next specifications:</em></strong> <ul>   <li>How fast and reliable is the internet?</li>   <li>Comfortable chairs and tables</li>   <li>Enough power outlets for charging your laptop and other technology</li>   <li>Quality of coffee/other drinks</li>   <li>Prices</li>   <li>Location</li>   <li>Atmosphere in the coffee shop</li> </ul> <em>Let\'s check out our favorite working cafes in Da Nang!</em> <h2><strong>Allen Coffee</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-4502 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.allen-coffee-1.jpg\" alt=\"Allen coffee\" width=\"1113\" height=\"828\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Photo was taken by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/allen.coffeesv/\">Allen Coffee</a></div>  By far our favorite cafe in Da Nang where you can do some serious work done! It\'s located just on the banks of Han River in Hai Chau district and their menu selection, friendly staff and countless tables to set up your office is simply amazing.  The cafe has a few floors, but due to lack of customers, only the first two floors are opened. There is a terrace where you can work, surrounded by trees and birds that can help you in focusing on the work. Also, almost every table has a power outlet which is a huge benefit for people who needs to do some work-  Coffee is very delicious and we\'re usually drinking their <strong>Ca Phe Sua Saigon (one of the best we had a chance to try in the city!)</strong>.  The cafe is a bit crowded during the morning hours since locals flock in to socialize and enjoy their morning coffee before hitting the work. Anyway, there are so many seats where you set up your office so it won\'t be a problem, but sometimes in these hours, the noise is a bit annoying.  <img class=\"wp-image-4503 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.allen-coffee-2.jpg\" alt=\"Allen coffee intierior\" width=\"810\" height=\"728\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Photo was taken by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/allen.coffeesv/\">Allen Coffee</a></div>  The Internet is stable and pretty fast.

Also, they are so friendly and they usually bring us a huge pot of delicious and potent tea free of cost.

Mua Cafe is an amazing place that is designed for students and remote workers in mind.  Whenever you come, you\'ll meet other digital nomads working on their project as well as dozens of students learning in a quiet area.  The cafe has three floors with few terraces. On the first floor, there are small tables and couches which isn\'t the best for working, but you can still do some work there. When you climb up to a second floor, there are just a few couches and many big tables with fans and AC where you can really do some great work.  At that floor, there is a quiet area with the AC where you have about 10 tables with very comfortable chairs and many power outlets. That\'s the place where we usually do some serious work.  Also, on the second floor, there are few small balconies with tiny chairs overlooking the street, so if that\'s your preferred place to work then you\'ll have an amazing time. A third floor is a small rooftop with few tables and chairs. People usually have meetings there and it\'s very hot to work during the day while during the night is loud and crowded.  <img class=\"wp-image-4511 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.mua-coffee.jpg\" alt=\"Being productive in Mua coffee\" width=\"628\" height=\"639\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Photo was taken by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/muacoffeedn/\">Mua Coffee Shop</a></div>  They have a huge selection of coffee and other fresh beverages like smoothies and juices (for juice, they, unfortunately, use syrup, not fresh fruit). Their prices range <strong>from 25,000 - 50,000 VND</strong>.  Also, the internet is very fast and reliable. They have few access points, so if you have trouble with one, you can easily switch to another one.  Another great thing we love about Mua Cafe is that they give you a glass bottle of water every time you go there, so you won\'t be dehydrated!  <strong>Facebook page: </strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/muacoffeedn/\">Mua Coffee Shop</a>  <strong>Location: </strong><a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/JmeK2QcFFq62\">Check on the map!</a>  <strong>Working hours: </strong>6 AM - 10:45 PM <h2><strong>Moon Coffee</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-4509 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.moon-coffee.jpg\" alt=\"Moon coffee interior\" width=\"1255\" height=\"816\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Photo was taken by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MooNCoffeeDaNang/\">Moon Coffee</a></div>  Are you a type of digital nomad who enjoys stunning views while working? If so, then Moon Cafe is probably the cafe to go!  It\'s located just next to a Dragon Bridge in Hai Chau district near Nguyen Van Linh street that connects the airport with the beach.  There are two floors, one airconditioned with chilled music and another on the rooftop which is more for the meetings than working. Also, on the first floor that is a small terrace where you can set up your office and have a direct view of Dragon Bridge. The only downside of the terrace is the noise since it\'s just on one of the busiest streets in Da Nang (a few more power outlets would be more than appreciated too!).  Inside, there are about 8 tables with power outlets where you can sit for a long period of time and focus on the work. There are few couches so if you prefer something like that, you\'ll love it. Also, there is a huge part where you can sit on the floor and set up your laptop on a small table. We usually love to work there as that\'s the perfect way to do a bit of stretching as you\'re working.  <img class=\"wp-image-4510 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.moon-coffee-2.jpg\" alt=\"Moon coffee balcony\" width=\"1257\" height=\"835\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Photo was taken by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MooNCoffeeDaNang/\">Moon Coffee</a></div>  Coffee and their menu selection is huge and the prices aren\'t too huge.

Whenever we come there, it\'s filled with like-minded people who\'re focusing on their projects. There is a small community of expats who are working every day together, so if you\'re looking to connect and get into the community in Da Nang, head over to this one.  The location is a bit outside the city, but it\'s just next to the beach which is perfect when you have to take a break from work. Once you set your feet to the cafe, you\'ll be greeted with a tiny garden area where you can set up your office. There are many tables outside as well inside in the air-conditioned area.  The Internet is probably one of the fastest and most reliable we had a chance to work on in Da Nang. Their coffee and beverage selection is huge!  If you\'re a coffee lover then you will definitely fall in love with this cafe since they have professional baristas who know a lot about coffee. You can also learn a lot from them as they are very passionate about their job!  That\'s one of the best places to enjoy an iconic Vietnamese coffee since they have many ways of preparation including cold brew, Aeropress, french press and pour over. Another interesting fact about their coffee is that they use 100% Arabica beans from the coffee farms around Da Lat.  <em>Did you know that the majority of Vietnamese coffee is made from cheaper and easier to produce Robusta beans?</em>  <strong>Learn more about Vietnamese coffee: </strong><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide\">A guide to traditional Vietnamese coffee</a>  Probably the best thing about Six on Six is that they have a menu with healthy meals and fresh fruit smoothies!

The whole design and coffee shop is based in and around <strong>4 ship containers</strong>.  Inside ship containers, there are cozy seats and tables with many power outlets. Outside you can enjoy a breeze and a tiny garden with a fish pond while working on the project.  They have a huge selection of coffee and sweet food like cakes and croissants.

The cafe is very spacious with many seats and tables and they are definitely after a simplistic design - we love it!  The wood and brick inter. The place has two floors with many tables where you can set up your office and also almost every table is just next to a power outlet.

Cafe has many seats and it\'s just located near Han River in the city center. There are many tables with wooden chairs, few couches and one the second floor, there is a quiet and comfortable room where you can do serious work.  Tables are very wide and power outlets are everywhere (hope you have a long cable).  As this is a souvenir shop too, try to <strong>avoid early morning hours</strong> as that\'s the time the tourists usually flock in to get <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/souvenirs-from-vietnam\">traditional souvenirs</a> and enjoy their time with a delicious and potent coffee.  They serve a traditional Vietnamese coffee as well as Italian coffee, fresh smoothies and juices, cocktails and beer.

If you\'re looking to work outside, be sure that you charged your laptop since they lack power outlets outside.  There is another, an air-conditioned area which is ideal to get some work done, just next to the garden that provides you with the views over the garden.

The white and black interior with a lot of natural lighting is a very refreshing and motivating for working there.  There are many tables with very comfortable seats where you can sit for hours and do some work, but the only problem is that the power outlets are a bit far away from tables, so don\'t mind bringing an extension cord with you.  Coffee is very tasty and there are many options when it comes to bakery delicacies.  We worked there a few times without any problems with the internet.

Well, why not to bring your bike to a neighbor Laos and experience untouched nature and off-the-beaten-track while having complete freedom?  <em>Many travelers don\'t know there is a possibility to cross the border from Vietnam to Laos by your motorbike! It\'s possible and usually (depending on the border) hustle free!</em>  Anyway, you have to be very picky when it comes to crossing point as some borders are impossible to cross/bribe required! Also, immigration officers tend to change the rules from day to day, so always have a backup plan.  Antonio crossed the Lao Bao / Dansavanh border, spent one-month driving and living in Laos and returned to Vietnam through the same border.  All without a single hustle! Not a single officer asked him about the motorbike!  <em><strong>Here\'s everything you have to know about bringing your motorbike to Laos and back!</strong></em> <h2><strong>Getting to Lao Bao From Da Nang/Hoi An/Hue</strong></h2> We already wrote a huge guide on doing a <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/visa-run-lao-bao\">visa run from Da Nang to Lao Bao</a> where we shared a complete and detailed route. Head over it to get more information.  I started the journey in Da Nang and stayed one night in sleepy Dong Ha before heading to Lao Bao border. Dong Ha is a perfect stop since it\'s just <strong>around 70 km away from Lao Bao border</strong> and the historic road provides you with stunning views over mountains, rivers and passes.  <em>Once you arrive at Lao Bao / Dansavanh border with your motorbike, here\'s what you have to do to cross to Laos:</em> <h2><strong>Required Documents For Crossing to Laos By Motorbike</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4546\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20181128_143828.jpg\" alt=\"Documents for border crossing with the motorbike\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" />  <em>There is some documentation you have to obtain before going to the border. Also, it depends on your plans - do you plan to go back to Vietnam after exploring Laos?</em>  I had a plan to spend a month in Laos while driving my beloved motorbike and then head back to Vietnam. To be able to do it, you have to <strong>obtain an invitation letter for Vietnam beforehand (original letter with the red stamp on it!)</strong>.  The immigration officer will ask you about your plans and invitation letter. After a short check, you\'ll get an exit stamp and you\'re ready to get a visa sticker for Laos. The process is effortless for getting Laos visa for a month.  You go to the counter for Visa on Arrival, fill the form, provide <strong>one passport photo and $35 for a visa</strong> (it depends on the nationality and ranges from $32 - $45).  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> My advice is to always have dollars with you since the officers will give you an inflated exchange rate for any other currency! Be careful with dollars since they check the condition of the bills, so be sure that you don\'t have ripped bills since they will reject taking them!</div>  <em><strong>To summarize, here are documents you\'ll need:</strong></em> <ul>   <li>passport photo</li>   <li>filled Laos VoA form</li>   <li>original invitation letter for Vietnam (in case you\'re planning to go back to Vietnam)</li>   <li>$32 - $45 for Laos visa</li>   <li>passport with more than 4 empty pages</li>   <li>blue card for your bike (no one asked me about any document related to my bike)</li> </ul> If you don\'t plan to visit Laos, but you\'re heading to Lao Bao just to do a visa run, head over to our detailed guide on <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/visa-run-vietnam\"><strong>doing a visa run from Vietnam</strong></a> that will answer all your questions related to infamous visa run. <h2><strong>Detailed Process of Crossing the Border With Your Motorbike</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4548\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.56422341_2313763188943884_6659745653175877632_n.jpg\" alt=\"Process of bringing motorbike from Vietnam to Laos\" width=\"1560\" height=\"1170\" />  Alright, so you\'re approaching Lao Bao border and you\'re getting all nervous overthinking about everything. Don\'t worry!  Keep reading as I\'m going to share all the information that will make your crossing to Laos with a motorbike effortless!  <em>Here you go:</em> <ul>   <li>Once you approach Lao Bao border, you\'ll stumble upon a building complex and the parking lot (on a Vietnam side). You can ignore that complex entirely since that\'s the place where you make a Vietnamese visa and getting an exit stamp from Laos. You don\'t need any of that, so you can slowly drive your bike further.</li>   <li>Soon, you\'ll approach another building complex that is on the Laos side. You have to park your motorbike there and go straight to \'Vietnam Exit Formalities\' house where the officer will check your current Vietnamese visa and the invitation letter for your return. Also, he might ask you about your plans to Laos. I was extremely opened and shared my complete plan and told him about the motorbike (some people suggested me not to talk about the motorcycle). Anyway, after a minute, he gave me an exit stamp from Vietnam.</li>   <li>After you get the exit stamp, you head over to Laos VoA counter where you have to fill a visa form, provide a passport photo, $35 for a sticker and you\'re ready to go. The whole process of getting a Laos visa will take about 10 minutes. No one asked me there about the motorbike, but they do ask me where do I go and what I plan to do.</li>   <li>The next step is getting back to your motorbike and bringing it to Laos. I left the backpacks and all the stuff tied to my bike while I was doing the process and everything was still there.</li>   <li>The most important is that you don\'t drive a bike around the border, but push it. Just push it next to \'Vietnam Exit Formalities\' and there will be a Vietnamese and Laos officer who will check your paper. They tend to be very interested and positive with a bit of knowledge of English. They didn\'t ask anything about the motorbike/or any paper.</li>   <li>When they checked my papers, I was about to turn on the bike, but the officer told me to push further. You push for the next 20 meters until you reach the next checkpoint. Smiling Laos officers greeted me with a loud<em><strong> \'Sabaidee\'</strong></em>, check my passport and visa, didn\'t ask for a single document for the bike and told me you\'re ready to go!</li> </ul> <strong>That\'s it! After one hour of the whole process, I was officially in Laos with my motorbike.</strong>  No questions or papers asked for the motorbike. It was relatively easy to pass the border. Also, few other travelers shared the same story.  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> There is a building that says <em>\'Vehicle Import\'</em> on the border. Don\'t go there! Officers will tell you to go there if you have a bigger bike. I was told that you should go there if you have a motorcycle bigger than 175cc.</div> <h2><strong>Best Place to Exchange Your Money</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4547\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.lao-kip.jpg\" alt=\"Exchange your money to Lao Kip at the border\" width=\"917\" height=\"642\" />  Alright, so the first struggle for me, after getting my motorbike to Laos, was where to get Lao Kip.  There will be few women around the border offering you to exchange the money, but I just gave them friendly no. They live off of exchange rate, so I guess the rate won\'t be in your favor.  Literally on the border (parallel to the place where you push your bike) are two banks - <strong>Lao Viet Bank and Phongsavanh Bank</strong>. Go over there and you\'ll get a fair exchange rate for your VND or USD. They even change Euros to Lao Kip.  I did a mistake and missed that place without any Lao Kip in my pocket. I ran out of fuel just in the small town with three banks. After checking two banks, they said to me the same, <em>\'Go to another bank, they change\'</em>. The last bank said no too, but I explained to them that I was in a bad situation and the manager went to the car and came back with a huge amount of Kips. They gave me an outstanding exchange rate and I had a wallet full of Lao Kip.  Be sure not to be an ignorant traveler and always check the current exchange rates, so you know if you have a good or bad deal. The banks or other exchange places are usually for negotiating about the rate if it\'s not official. I advise you to use XE Exchange, a lightweight and cool app that will keep you updated on the current rates. Also, we wrote about other <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/mobile-apps-vietnam\">handy mobile apps for your motorbike trip</a>! <h2><strong>Other Helpful Tips for the Road</strong></h2> <ul>   <li>I advise you to start your journey early and get to the border before the lunch break. I was told by many people to avoid 11 am - 2 pm, and despite that, I literally arrived at 12 am. There was no other tourist, and I had the process done so fast. Officers were very friendly and helpful too.</li>   <li>Change your money to Lao Kip in the bank on the border to avoid the awkward situations that can happen later on the road.</li>   <li>Try to reach Savannakhet or Thakhek before dark since there are no street lights on the road. Don\'t worry, the road from Dansavanh all the way to Savannakhet is the best road I\'ve ever driven on in SEA. I was cruising at 75 - 80 km/h with my Honda Wave all the time. Also, there is almost no one on the road, so it\'s very easy to drive.</li>   <li>Be careful of cows and goats on the road!</li>   <li>Cover your skin with long sleeves since Laos is extremely hot! It was so hot during my visit in early March!</li>   <li>Always have enough water with you. If you run out of the water, you can always ask on the gas station and people will fill your water bottle free of any cost.</li>   <li>There are few small villages on the way to Savannakhet, so be sure that you always fill your bike once you\'re in the town as the gas stations are pretty far away from each other.</li>   <li>If you have a modified bike or you don\'t have two mirrors, fix it and change it! Police there doesn\'t care if you\'re a foreigner or local. They are pretty notorious for bribes and they see you like the opportunity to earn some money. I had a modified exhaust and spent a few hours in the police station after police caught me.</li>   <li>Maintaining and fixing the bike in Laos is easy since there are many local mechanics on the road. It\'s a bit more expensive than Vietnam but still affordable and mechanics know how to get the job done. A regular price for an oil change is 30k LK. Don\'t pay more!</li> </ul> <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>For the end, there are some pictures from the journey to Savannakhet. :)</strong></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4533\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.56466304_2222656797817849_7309932048850878464_n.jpg\" alt=\"Dong Ha to Savannakhet\" width=\"472\" height=\"840\" />  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4540\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.57049191_470357087039250_3042597752094588928_n.jpg\" alt=\"Just first few kilometers into Laos\" width=\"1170\" height=\"1560\" />  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4534\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.56524983_442265169861776_4712258308365352960_n.jpg\" alt=\"Windy road\" width=\"1560\" height=\"1170\" />  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4535\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.56547289_316047592417113_6860825168592240640_n.jpg\" alt=\"A photosession with the bike\" width=\"1560\" height=\"1170\" />  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4538\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.56806539_2226721724079614_6724545392433692672_n.jpg\" alt=\"Getting to the first village in Laos\" width=\"1560\" height=\"1170\" />  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4531\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.56310287_1193666334137533_6498462793623142400_n.jpg\" alt=\"Reaching a small town\" width=\"1560\" height=\"1170\" />  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4532\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.56452014_826246137753623_2745734414368505856_n.jpg\" alt=\"Chasing the sunset near Savannakhet\" width=\"1170\" height=\"1560\" />  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4539\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.56879440_435505910340851_7538709529186271232_n.jpg\" alt=\"Police ticket\" width=\"1170\" height=\"1560\" /> <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Wish you a safe trip and successful crossing to Laos.

Well, is there anything better than getting your hands on some weed and enjoying the smoke while exploring the beautiful sights the city has to offer, educating yourself about Vietnamese history or taking a part in probably the best nightlife in Vietnam?  There are many things to do, especially when it comes to nightlife! Many backpackers and travelers who\'re looking for crazy nights head down to Saigon. Weed, alcohol and other things are very available in the city, so you shouldn\'t experience any problems when getting some cannabis!  <em><strong>Keep reading as we\'re going to provide you with a complete guide on getting and smoking weed in Saigon!</strong></em>  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This article was not written to promote the use of illegal substances, but to make their consumption as safe as possible.

Businesses are popping up each day and more tourists are coming to have a crazy time there.  On the paper, for having just a little cannabis on you, you can serve a lifetime in a labor prison, or even get executed. Many people will advise you not to smoke any weed in Vietnam, but just keep reading and you\'ll get the idea how is the situation there!  <strong>Learn more: <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/cannabis-in-vietnam\">All you have to know about weed in Vietnam</a>!</strong>  Well, as a communist country, corruption levels are very high, especially among police and lower levels of government. It means that almost in any case if you get caught, the police will try to get as much money as possible from you. Please have in mind it\'s only applicable for getting caught while smoking and having a small stash on you. If you get caught carrying huge quantities around, then you can expect a crazy time with police and probably the bribe won\'t save you!  Weed scene is huge in Saigon and there are areas where you\'ll see expats and locals smoking and rolling openly in the middle of the road. Some places are filled with police and still, you can smell cannabis all around. Police don\'t look so much concerned about the tourists, but always use your common sense and avoid smoking in public places.  There is a huge possibility that if you get caught nothing will happen, but the hustle with the police is usually crazy as there is a language barrier and also, you will lose a lot of time and money just for one joint. Be smart and smoke on secluded places to avoid it! <h2><strong>Where to Get Weed in Saigon</strong></h2> <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IE33_hir1c8\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  Getting weed in Saigon is very easy and you must be very unlucky not to get your hands on some cannabis. The quality can vary a lot, but still, for the price you pay you will definitely get a certain buzz.  Saigon is known for a vibrant nightlife so it\'s not a surprise to see many tourists and expats having the best time of their lives around the city. Once you\'re walking around the streets of Saigon, you will smell cannabis here and there.  Your best bet is by checking the popular backpackers\' street called <em><strong>Bui Vien street</strong></em>. The nightlife there is very vibrant and many street shops are around. Also, the bars filled with tourists are at each step, and you will definitely smell some cannabis from some of these.

Some people reported being scammed and not getting the real cannabis, so if possible, always try to check out the stuff before giving your money away.  There are hundreds of ways how you can get scammed in Vietnam. Read our <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam\"><strong>guide on avoiding most common scams</strong></a>!  Don\'t forget to check the intersection between <em><strong>Pham Ngu Lao street and De Tham street</strong></em> as there will be always a few motorbike drivers chilling and offering cannabis.  We found cannabis by checking the party events where foreigners come, so it was very easy to score some cannabis there. The best bet would be to get to know expats who\'re living in the city for a longer period as they probably have connections.  Also, don\'t forget to check party hostels around Saigon! <h2><strong>Cannabis Prices in Saigon</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4563\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.where-to-get-cannabis-in-saigon.jpg\" alt=\"Cannabis prices in Saigon\" width=\"1280\" height=\"784\" />  Prices usually vary depending on the quantity, quality, and connections you have. Expats and locals usually get good prices compared to tourists as they already know people and places to go. Your best bet is to make friends with them and let them hook you up with their connection. That way, you\'re sure to get the best bang for your buck.  Taxi drivers will often sell you a small bag of around 3 grams for <strong>500,000 VND (around $20)</strong>, but the quality is very low. You can always negotiate the price with them and sometimes if you\'re lucky, you can get the same amount for half of the price.  For 10 grams of low-quality domestic buds, you can expect to pay around 500,000 VND. These buds look very bad, but the high will be decent when you put more in one joint.  The kush is popular there, but it\'s mainly for the tourists which means the quality isn\'t comparable to the kush and the prices vary from <strong>500,000 - 1,000,000 VND for a single gram</strong>.  <hr />  Saigon is a very awesome city where you can do many things and enjoy a crazy nightlife. No matter which day of the week you decide to go to a party, there will be always something going on. Getting your hands on weed in Saigon is pretty easy and kind of safe, but always use your common sense. The laws are strict, but no one seems to force them, so even if you get caught, you can expect to pay a bribe that is usually around $100 or more.  Remember one thing! In Vietnam, you can always negotiate the price!  Enjoy your stay in Saigon! :)  Are you in Vietnam now?

Mui Ne might be the perfect place you\'d like to visit as it\'s located on the southern coast in the middle of the desert. It\'s the capital of windsurfing in Vietnam as the wind always creates huge waves that are ideal for surfing or windsurfing.  Mui Ne is a popular backpacker spot with many parties going on, so if you\'re looking to get some weed in Mui Ne, you shouldn\'t be worried! Streets are filled with cannabis and almost on every step you\'ll smell some cannabis, especially during the night.  <em><strong>Looking to get some weed in Mui Ne?

You should you decide to break the law on your own accord. VietnamChronicles does not condone the consumption of cannabis.

On the paper, for the possession of small amounts of cannabis, you can end up in a Vietnamese prison for many years. It\'s important to note that it\'s only on the paper, as the law practice related to cannabis is totally different in Vietnam.  If you\'re scared of getting cannabis in Vietnam, we advise you to check our complete guide on <strong><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/cannabis-in-vietnam\">Vietnam cannabis scene</a></strong>.  The country still struggles with corruption and communism, and the salaries of police officials are usually low, so they are looking for the way to supplement their salaries every day. The most common way to do it is by getting the bribes from foreigners, but also from locals.  Mui Ne is a small coastal town with many resorts and even more tourists around. It\'s easy to get your hands on cannabis there, but also, very easy to get stopped and searched by police. Always use your common sense and have a separated wallet just in case you\'ll face the police in Mui Ne.  Looking for other adventures nearby? Head over to Phan Rang that is a small city located just about 3 hours motorbike drive from Mui Ne. The city is known for delicious food, local vibe and <strong><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/phan-rang-kitesurfing\">world\'s famous kitesurfing</a>.</strong>  The police will usually ask you for a huge bribe in order to get out of the unpleasant situation, but believe us, you should always bargain. They will settle with the 30% or even less of the first asking price. Although it really depends on the quantity of cannabis you had on you. If you had more than 25 grams, then don\'t try to negotiate and pay the asking price as it can be seen as the distribution or selling purpose.  Just use your common sense, don\'t be a drunk tourist walking in the middle of the road while smoking joint and yelling on people and you\'d be fine. (We saw that scene in Mui Ne quite often!) <h2><strong>Where to Get Weed in Mui Ne</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4603\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.where.jpg\" alt=\"Getting weed in mui ne is extremely easy\" width=\"1002\" height=\"748\" />  Getting cannabis in Mui Ne is very easy. You don\'t need to do almost anything, as the local drivers will always approach you and ask you do you want some weed. They usually hang out near ATMs, so if you can\'t find them, just head near the ATMs and you will have many offers.  The problem is that the weed from street sellers is usually low-quality and under-quantity, so you will have a hard time to get the buzz. Also, there are many stories of foreigners that got tea or just a grass instead of cannabis, so be careful.  We were talking with few people who shared the story of a few backpackers who got snitched by the dealer who sold them cannabis to police. They paid a huge bribe and probably police and dealers are sharing it. Be careful when doing it, and never do it near your place of stay.  Mui Ne area is unfortunately known for many scams going on. Check out the <strong><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam\">biggest list of Vietnam scams</a> </strong>and how to avoid them. Also, if you\'ve ever got caught by the police, here\'s a guide on <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-police-guide\"><strong>how to deal with Vietnamese police successfully</strong></a>.  We bought few bags of cannabis from street dealers and the weed quality is very bad. They always ask for a big price, but you just keep lowering the price and you can get it for a very cheap price. Also, they are very hesitant to give you the bag to take a look and smell it, but just insist on doing it and they will give it to you. They always have a cigarette pack with many bags inside, so probably some bags are filled with tea, grass or other things that can look like cannabis to the untrained eye.  The deal is always crazy as you will get the weed literally in the middle of a busy street, so be extra careful and check your surroundings always!  Another better way to score some weed is by checking the <strong>Dragon Beach Club</strong>, especially during the weekends. There are always huge parties with locals and foreigners and you will always smell a lot of cannabis there. Just keep your eyes open and ask around. You will definitely get your hands on weed pretty fast.  Also, head over to backpacker hostels and ask people around/front-desk. They will usually help you to connect you with the right people.  Just don\'t worry! It is a very impossible mission to not get your hands on any weed in Mui Ne. <h2><strong>Cannabis Prices in Mui Ne</strong></h2> <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A7J_h1p9grQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  In Mui Ne, there are usually two kinds of cannabis - a Vietnamese grown and Cambodian import. Both kinds are very low-potent and won\'t get you the best high, but it\'s working a bit.  When we were smoking, the high was lasting maybe for 20 minutes and then you need to roll another one. Also, many people said they had a headache, but we didn\'t experience it, just crazy red eyes all the time.  When it comes to prices, on the street, dealers will usually ask you for <strong>900,000 VND for Cambodian and 600,000 VND for Vietnamese sort</strong> (a baggie of claimed 5 grams that looks like 2 grams at its best).  We\'ve got our price lowered from 600,000 VND to 250,000 VND, so always bargain and don\'t forget to check the bag before buying it.  The prices in the clubs and backpackers hostels are similar and on average you can expect to pay around <strong>500,000 VND for 5 grams of really low-quality cannabis.</strong>  <hr />  Mui Ne is a very interesting small town with stunning beaches and crazy huge waves. If you\'re into windsurfing or surfing, then you should definitely head over there. Also, there are Red and White sand dunes which look totally out of this world. Cannabis is very easy to get and relatively safe to smoke there.  Just use your common sense and don\'t get scammed. Enjoy your stay in Mui Ne! :)  <em>Traveling through Vietnam?

We\'ve been living and traveling around Vietnam for almost two years and surprisingly, in every conversation, you\'ll hear about delicious Vietnamese cuisine. When we think a bit about our experiences with food in Vietnam, it\'s not actually that surprising that people LOVE Vietnamese food.  <em>Who won\'t fall in love with fresh, diverse, complex and cheap food on every step?</em>  Literally, you can smell tasty food on every step and try a different cuisine every day. Another interesting fact is that cuisine drastically changes once you start to travel around the country.  We\'ve talked with 10 bloggers and influencers who\'ve been living or traveling around Vietnam and they shared their favorite Vietnamese traditional food. <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>10 Vietnamese Street Food You Have to Try (According to Bloggers and Influencers)</strong></h2> <h2><strong>#1 Chuối nướng (Grilled Banana)</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4695\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.grilled-banana.jpg\" alt=\"Grilled banana from the South Vietnam\" width=\"1161\" height=\"775\" />  If you\'re walking down a street market in Vietnam and happen to catch the undeniably tantalizing smell of caramelized bananas, follow that intoxicating aroma to a vendor dishing up one of Vietnam\'s most delicious desserts, chuối nướng (or grilled or barbecued banana).  Originating in the Mekong Delta, where bananas are plentiful, chuối nướng can be prepared two ways: either with a plain grilled banana, toasted over a fire, or, alternatively, wrapped in sticky rice and banana leaf and cooked until the rice turns a golden brown (this variety is technically called \"chuối bọc nếp nướng\").  Once the banana is cooked to puffy, delicious perfection, it is drowned in luscious, creamy coconut milk and dried sesame or peanuts are sprinkled on top. Served piping hot, this dish is best enjoyed when the ingredients are thoroughly mixed together, to get a full mouthfeel of the soft banana, the decadently silky coconut milk, and the savory crunch of the nutty toppings.  Although you can hunt down this dish in Hanoi and throughout the northern cities of Vietnam, chuối nướng is much more prevalent in Southern cities, like Ho Chi Minh City, Can Tho or My Tho.  And the best part? Since this is pretty much exclusively served up as street food, a serving will usually set you back a whole <strong>15,000 – 20,000 VND</strong>.

After sampling all of the street food that Hanoi has to offer, you should splurge on one meal - the Fried Duck at Grandma\'s.  One of the top restaurants in Hanoi, Grandma\'s serves traditional North Vietnamese cuisine. One of its signature dishes is a crispy fried duck. You may have eaten duck elsewhere, but Grandma\'s is different. The pieces of duck are breaded and deep fried. Admittedly, not your healthiest meal, but tender and tasty. It comes with fried rice cakes and pickled vegetables.  The fried duck <strong>costs 299,000 VND (approximately $13USD)</strong>. As we said, Grandma\'s Fried Duck is a splurge, but worth it. Grandma\'s is in the Old Quarter not far from Hoan Kiem Lake and a good place to stop on your <a href=\"https://travelforlifenow.com/hanoi-itinerary-5-days/\"><strong>Hanoi itinerary</strong></a>.

Around every corner and on every street, there is fresh, local food. After getting your fill of Pho and Banh Mi, if that\'s even possible in Vietnam, find something a little different. Search for Bánh Đa Trộn.  To put it simply, Banh Da Tron is a bowl of deliciousness. It looks like a dressed up bowl of Phở without the broth. To be specific, Bánh đa trộn is a bowl of noodles and chopped fish sausage patties. All of this is in a fish paste and topped with crispy strips of squid.  For many people, the ingredients don\'t sound appetizing. Somehow, it\'s perfect all together. The sausage doesn\'t taste fishy or odd; instead, it\'s a unique savory flavor. The noodles complement the crunchy squid. As always, hot sauce and chili paste is on the table.  Bánh đa trộn is not a particularly typical dish but is found in a few places in Hanoi. In the Old Quarter, a few local shops that see minimal tourist traffic serve Bánh đa trộn. To my delight, I stumbled upon a family noodle shop a couple of blocks south of Pub Street. At the time, all I knew was it was good. In the end, that\'s all that matters.

The sandwich is made with a French baguette-style bread that is crunchy on the outside but soft and doughy on the inside. The baguette is then filled several different ingredients, usually some combination of vegetables, meat, fresh herbs and sauce.  There are many meat-based versions of the bánh mì, but vegan versions made with tofu or with mock meat also exist and are called bánh mì chay (\"chay\" is the word for vegan or vegetarian food in Vietnamese). It\'s a monster of a sandwich and can be very messy to eat, but that\'s all part of the fun!  One of the best places to try a bánh mì for the first time is at Bánh Mì Phuong, a local institution in Hoi An (<a href=\"https://saigoneer.com/eat-drink/eat-drink-categories/saigon-food-culture/16485-hoi-an-s-banh-mi-phuong-opens-first-overseas-branch-in-seoul\"><strong>opened the first store in Korea</strong></a>) that became famous for its bánh mì after Anthony Bourdain ate there and called it \"a symphony in a sandwich\". The usual version is filled with meat and other animal products, but they will make a vegetarian or <a href=\"https://www.thenomadicvegan.com/vegan-vietnam-tour-package/\"><strong>vegan version of this classic Vietnamese dish</strong></a> on request.

Bánh cuốn is traditionally a Northern Vietnamese dish and can be found on almost every corner in Hanoi. It\'s also commonly served for breakfast at <a href=\"https://wander-lush.org/vietnam-homestays/\"><strong>homestays in Northern Vietnam</strong></a>. It consists of steamed rice flour pancakes stuffed and rolled with an excellent pork and mushroom filling.  Bánh cuốn is typically served with a bowl of nước chấm dipping sauce on the side and in Hanoi, with a soft-friend egg on top (local\'s choice). My favorite way to eat bánh cuốn is with cubes of chả lụa (pork sausage inflected with spices such as cinnamon) on the side.  The best bánh cuốn is made fresh to order. It\'s a joy to watch street stall owners ladle out the rice flour batter, raising and lowering the steel lid of the steamer and peeling back the delicate pancakes. For \'fast-food\', it\'s quite a time-consuming and artful process.  I never got tired of eating bánh cuốn when I lived in Hanoi for a year. In Vietnam\'s capital, you can find bánh cuốn stalls everywhere—just look for the distinctive steamer set up in the front of the stall or shop.  Special thanks to Emily for this amazing entry.

Most food travelers don\'t know that Vietnam makes some of the best roast sucking pig in the world! A suckling pig is a young pig, which is why it is so tender. It is normally roasted over an open flame, outdoors. Each restaurant has its own special seasoning, where they often use a syringe to inject the seasoning into the pig.  The skin is usually based in coconut milk, making it super sweet and crispy. It\'s not easy to find suckling pig in Vietnam. It\'s not on a typical Vietnamese restaurant menu. Instead, it\'s most commonly found in countryside restaurants in small villages. The best suckling pig comes from Central Vietnam, around Hue, Danang, and in Quang Tri Province.  If you\'re traveling around Da Nang, apart from delicious and diverse Vietnamese street food, don\'t forget to explore natural heaven called <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/son-tra-peninsula\"><strong>Son Tra Peninsula</strong></a>.  It\'s ordered by the half or whole pig and comes to the table sliced in pieces. The pig is typically served with a little mixture of salt, pepper, chili, and lime, to spice up the meat. And, it is almost always washed down with a cold Vietnamese beer served in a glass, over ice.  In a country where many dishes cost only a dollar or two, order a half pig is more of an investment, often costing the equivalent of <strong>150,000 - 300,000 VND</strong> depending on the restaurant. But, it\'s a great value and a must-eat traditional Vietnamese dish.

Found in restaurants, homes and especially on small street food stalls around the country, it\'s a dish you simply must try when visiting Vietnam. If you are in <a href=\"https://myadventuresacrosstheworld.com/things-to-do-in-hanoi/\"><strong>Hanoi</strong></a>, make sure to wander the narrow streets of the Old Quarter and spot where the majority of locals sit: that\'s bound to be a good place for pho.  The soup consists of a thin broth made by cooking beef bones for several hours. The soup is served in a large bowl with flat rice noodles, spring onions and thin slices of raw beef which cooks with the heat of the broth. You also get a small plate with bean sprouts, mint and coriander leaves, sliced chilies and lime to add to your taste.  Pho bo is served throughout the day - though apparently Vietnamese people enjoy it most for breakfast. You eat it with a spoon which you use for the broth, and chopsticks which you use for the noodles and all other ingredients.  Special thanks to Claudia for this amazing entry.

This tasty, predominately <a href=\"https://theroamingfork.com/vietnamese-breakfast-dishes/\"><strong>breakfast dish</strong></a>, is brought together by adding noodles (Bun) and cuts of meat, which can include beef (Bo), pork, bone marrow, small balls of prawns and crab, and sometimes cubes of congealed pigs blood.  The above ingredients are added to a rich broth, which has a complex flavor and is the backbone of the dish. Making the broth is usually a time-consuming affair, with pork and beef bones being simmered for hours, with a combination of lemongrass, shrimp paste, pineapple, and chili, added along the way. The red tinge to the dish comes from the addition of annatto oil.  The ingredients result in a soup that has a full flavor, yet is citrusy, a touch spicy, a little sweet, and with a long and pleasing aftertaste.  Add more chili, lime, and herb from the table to further enhance the soup.  Despite the origins of the dish being from Hue, <span class=\"_5yl5\">Bún bò huế</span> can be found all over the country, from Hue themed restaurants, through to carts on the side of the road.  And at the cost of <strong>between 20,000 - 40,000 VND</strong>, this is a dish not be missed on your Vietnam adventures.  Special thanks to Markus for this amazing entry.

This mouthwatering noodle dish is a specialty from Quang Nam, which is one of the largest provinces located in the center of Vietnam.  It\'s special because of its uniqueness. Surprisingly, its uniqueness is from its diversification in the ingredients to cook it.  Mì quảng is an excellent combination from perfect soft, chewy noodle, stewed meat (or fish, chicken…); thick and savory broth which is an extract after long stewing meat(fish, chicken) with spices; fresh mixed vegetable; peanut; and grilled rice paper.  Squeeze a piece of lime, crumble grilled rice paper, put some chili pepper and fish sauce (if you\'re sure you can eat spicy food combined with fish sauce) in your bowl of Mì quảng.  Mix it up and you can smell the scent from endless green rice-fields, feel cool water from long streams, taste the salt from our farmers\' sweat and sweet from Vietnamese\' hearts. The bowl of delicious and mouthwatering noodles costs <strong>from 15,000 - 30,000 VND</strong>.  Special thanks to Alice for this amazing entry.

Before coming to Vietnam, I never was a \"breakfast guy\" but living here for 8 months now, I learned to love it.  My perfect morning always includes a <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide\"><strong>Vietnamese traditional coffee</strong></a> and Ốp La Bộ Xúc Xic.  Ốp La means fried egg, Bộ means beef and Xúc Xic is a sausage. So it\'s mainly a fried egg with some pieces of beef and sausage. At my favorite place, they prepare it in a special plate of stone and mix it all together. They also add some corn, potato and onion. They serve crispy bread and a fresh green salad (cucumber and lettuce topped with oil).  It\'s a pretty simple but amazing dish. Also, it never gets boring and I could eat it every day. The price of a delicious plate will cost you anywhere <strong>from 15,000 - 40,000 VND</strong>.

Many people are traveling around Vietnam on a daily basis and there is so many information on the internet on that, but in this article, I’m going to provide you with the ultimate guide for your motorbike trip in Vietnam.   <em>Find a comfortable place, brew yourself a delicious coffee and keep reading!</em> <h2><b>Pre-Arrival to Vietnam</b></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4734\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.prearrival-to-vietnam.jpg\" alt=\"Flying to Vietnam\" width=\"1180\" height=\"773\" />  First and foremost, you have to figure out the documentation required to get into Vietnam. Depending on your home country, the process for gathering all the required documents may slightly differ.   <em>Here is a list of documents you have to sort out before visiting:</em> <h3><b>How to Arrange a Tourist/Business Visa</b></h3> Well, Vietnam still requires a visa for the majority of countries, but it’s extremely easy to get a tourist visa for up to 3 months. The country allows visa on arrival for 150 countries, so <a href=\"https://www.myvietnamvisa.com/which-countries-are-eligible-vietnam-visa-arrival.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>check out the list</strong></a> to be sure what’s the process for getting a visa for your country.   To get a visa on arrival, you need to have a letter of approval that you show at the airport and they make a visa for you. There are many tourist agencies that will make a letter for a visa you want for a really small cost. We always get a three-month tourist visa letter for $15 - $30.  We wrote a complete guide on <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-tourist-visa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>getting a Vietnam tourist visa</strong></a> where you can get all the information about the process, costs, types and exempts.  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> <strong>NOTE:</strong> Be sure that you have the letter with you when coming to the airport as you may face problems getting into the plane without the letter. If you\'re flying into Vietnam, then you don\'t have to have an original letter (red stamp). It\'s enough to just print out the letter the agency sent to you. For land borders, it\'s important that you have an original letter with you. </div> <h3><b>Getting the Cheapest Flight Ticket</b></h3> Once you figured out your visa, it’s time to book a flight ticket. My favorite way to do it is by checking aggregator sites like <a href=\"https://www.skyscanner.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Skyscanner</strong></a> or <a href=\"https://www.cheapoair.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>CheapOair</strong></a>. They collect the cheapest tickets around the world and present them to you. Also, don\'t forget to check <a href=\"https://kiwi.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Kiwi.com</strong></a>.   <strong>NOTE: </strong>Be cautious with Kiwi since the service combines different flight companies and there is a probability they won\'t cover your missed flight (they also have the insurance for missed flights!). Also, don\'t forget to search for flight tickets in incognito mode on your browser.   The only advice for buying a flight ticket is to pick the right season. For example, the period from July - September is known as a rainy season and that’s the time when there are not many tourists around, so tickets and other things in the country are priced a bit lower.   If you’re scared that you will only experience the rain, please don’t be as the country is very long and north mainly experiences a lot of rain, while central and southern parts of the country usually have great weather all the time.  <h3><b>Which Travel Insurance to Get?</b></h3> Always have travel insurance as you never know what may happen on the road (advice from a guy without travel insurance who paid $500 for a simple check). Hopefully, nothing bad will happen, but you never know, especially when you’re traveling through rough terrains of Vietnam.   The hospitals are very good and clean in the big cities (expect to spend a lot without insurance) but in the small towns around the countryside, the hospitals might look like you\'ve got into a horror movie. Countryside hospitals are usually full, the staff doesn\'t speak English and the cleanliness level is questionable.   <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> <strong>NOTE: </strong>After Antonio crashed the bike, he went to a local hospital in the countryside and he had a good experience. Doctors knew how to speak basic English and they treated him well. On the other hand, he went to an international hospital and he said the service was outstanding, but it costs a small fortune without insurance.</div> <h3><b>International Driving License - Is It Necessary?</b></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4739\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.traffic-in-vietnam.jpg\" alt=\"Is it necessary to get international driving license in Vietnam?\" width=\"1137\" height=\"629\" />  Before coming to the country, even if you don’t plan to travel around the country by motorbike, don\'t forget to get an international driver license. There are so many stunning places around the country and experience is by far better driving on your own.  Police in Vietnam is very corrupt and they usually don’t target foreigners (in the countryside), but if you have the accident and you don’t have a proper license, then the insurance won’t cover your costs.  In case you\'re planning to stay in Vietnam for a while, the viable option would be to get a <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-driving-license\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Vietnamese driving license</strong></a>. <h2><b>Essential Things for Your Backpack</b></h2> Vietnam has a monsoon and tropical climate through almost a whole year, so pack light clothes if you’re planning to visit anytime except December - March. These few months are a bit colder, especially in the north, so prepare accordingly.  Temperatures and stability of weather get much higher after <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/tet-holiday-vietnam\"><strong>Tet holiday</strong></a> that falls on the first week of February. Last year, from November all the way to early February, it was raining a lot in central Vietnam.  In cold months, temperatures reach 15°C but don’t get fooled as it is extremely cold because of the high humidity in the air. You will be fine, but always check the weather in the part of the country you’re planning to go.  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> <strong>Friendly tip:</strong> Bring sunscreen and any other cosmetic things from your country. Sunscreen is so expensive in Vietnam, taking into account the quality. Also, it\'s almost impossible to find a sunscreen without whitening effect (read: some hard chemicals).</div>  Now when you have sorted out the documentation and have proper things in your backpacks, it’s time to talk a bit about the budget and transportation around Vietnam.  <h2><b>Budget &amp; Transportation Options</b></h2> Vietnam became a very attractive country for backpackers as it is relatively cheap compared to the western world, but also, it gives a variety of options when it comes to luxury travel. No matter your style of traveling, you will definitely find what suits you in Vietnam for a reasonable price.   If you’re planning to travel around the whole country in a month or similar period, then this guide would be perfect for you as we did it, so we can share some tips with you!  Check out our detailed post where we shared all details on <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget\"><strong>how much money we spent during our one-month motorbike trip</strong></a>. <h2><b>Budget Breakdown of Our Motorbike Trip in Vietnam</b></h2> I traveled around the whole country in 30 days driving the motorbike. That way is becoming more and more popular, especially after <a href=\"https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6bvfro\"><strong>Top Gear’s special episode</strong></a> where the crew did the motorbike trip around Vietnam.  Check this episode out to get an idea what to expect during your motorbike trip around stunning Vietnam (not really! Always expect unexpectable in Vietnam).  <h3><strong>Accommodation</strong></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4722\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.accommodation.jpg\" alt=\"Accommodation in Vietnam is pretty basic, but can be luxury if you\'re looking for it.\" width=\"1237\" height=\"749\" />  We\'ve traveled on a backpackers’ budget and I must say we didn’t lack anything. The majority of budget planning was related to accommodation, but sometimes we booked more comfortable homestay or hotel to relax after a long time being on the road.  Basically, for accommodation, you can expect to pay from <strong>70,000 - 150,000 VND/person</strong> for a nice and cozy hostel in a shared room. These rooms are amazing if you’re a solo traveler as you will always meet travelers who\'re doing the same trip.   Also, if you want privacy, but don’t have an opportunity to pay more, go for capsule hostels! If you’re traveling in a group, I advise you to always book a homestay or hostel in the 4-bed-shared room. The prices will be similar for a person, but you will have more privacy for your group.  On average, we spent about <strong>130,000 VND/person</strong> for accommodation. We really stayed everywhere; from dirty hostels all the way to very stunning private homestays. It really depends on your style of traveling how much you\'re going to spend. If you\'re on a shoestring budget, there are many backpacker\'s hostels with the price starting as low as <strong>40,000 VND for a bed</strong>.  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> <strong>Friendly tip:</strong> Always check the user\'s reviews and the users rating on the platform. Some hostels/homestays will have a great description and pictures, but when you come here, you will be disappointed how misleading it is! Don’t make the same mistake as I did! :)</div> <h3><strong>Food &amp; Drinks</strong></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4744\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.food-in-vietnam.jpg\" alt=\"Food in Vietnam\" width=\"1186\" height=\"753\" />  Believe me, there is an unlimited food option starting from the diverse street food, all the way to upscale restaurants with stunning views (do it if you\'re looking for a spoil, but the food can\'t compare to street food!).  On our trip, we didn’t save much money when it comes to food, but we picked the places where the food was fairly priced (read eat where locals eat).  We usually spent around<strong> 50,000 VND for a huge meal</strong> (including drinks sometimes). Always go for the street food where you can find many locals eating as it means the food is great and not overpriced. If you can’t see the prices, always ask for the prices in front as some people will definitely take advantage of you being a foreigner.   Don’t be surprised if you see locals are paying less money than you as they are eating there probably every day and know people around. Even if you get charged a bit extra, it won’t affect you for sure!   My advice always goes for street food as you will get amazing portions for a reasonable price and also the variety of food is amazing. If you’re scared that the food preparation or ingredients aren’t clean, don’t be! Many people are eating there and nothing happens. Also, our travel group had three members and we never experienced any stomach problems, except when we were drinking their homemade rice wine. Be careful with that stuff! :)  When it comes to drinks, expect to pay a peanut amount for domestic beers, delicious and strong coffee and all other drinks. Also, don’t forget to try their fresh beer (Bia Hoi or Bia Tuoi). It’s usually a homemade beer made by locals that goes so well with street food. In some places, we found <strong>2L of fresh beer for whopping 20,000 VND</strong> which is less than a dollar!   <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> <strong>Environmental tip:</strong> Please invest in a reusable water bottle as Vietnam is lacking the infrastructure for recycling so all the plastic is being burned or end up in the ocean. Good reusable bottles will cost you around $30. Another viable option is buying a plastic reusable BPA-free bottle for a few dollars in every bigger supermarket (BigC has many choices).</div>  Almost every household has a huge water source and people are very hospitable, so they will welcome you with their hands opened if you ask for a bit of water. It saves the environment and also your wallet!   So, to conclude the budget for the food, expect to put aside about <strong>200,000 VND daily for food and drinks (backpacker\'s budget)</strong>. <h3><strong>Transportation</strong></h3> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4741\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.transportation-in-vietnam.jpg\" alt=\"Transportation in Vietnam\" width=\"998\" height=\"720\" />  Vietnam is a fast developing country, so transportation options won\'t lack. Traveling around the country is possible with shuttles, buses, trains, planes, taxis, cars, motorbikes, and a variety of self-made vehicles (don\'t try it please).   We chose the last mean of transportation - a motorbike. This way became very popular among backpackers and hundreds of people are doing a trip every day. It’s not a strange thing that motorbike market became very huge and it is very easy to get a motorbike and sell it after you’re doing with a trip.  Check out this backpackers group to see which motorbikes are on the market and what are the prices. I’ve got myself a Sufat Win (Vietnamese version of Honda) and <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/motorbike-in-vietnam\"><strong>I’ve got it as a gift in Hanoi</strong></a>. Usually, these bikes have a price of around $200 and you can, with a bit of luck, sell it for the same price.   If you decide on a motorbike, then expect to pay around $200 - $400 for a decent bike. I really advise you to invest a bit more as this extra buck will save you a lot of time on the road! More on that soon! :)  We drove around 200 km on average on every trip. It seems like nothing on the paper, but believe me, these rides can sometimes take you a whole day!   <strong>If you want to have an accurate time estimation, multiple Google Maps estimation by two! </strong>  The roads are in very bad conditions in some parts, the traffic can be crazy and also, weather, nature and motorbike breakdowns will be your daily friends.   The cost for gas is around <strong>20,000 VND for a liter</strong> and you can usually <strong>drive up to 50 km on one liter</strong>. So, depending on your plan, the gas costs will vary. Also, you need to regularly maintain your motorbike which includes tightening the brakes, chain and changing the oil every 500 - 1,000 km.   The oil change costs around 100,000 VND. Breakdowns are inevitable, but luckily small mechanic shops are on each step. These people usually know how to fix everything when it comes to Honda (or replica) bikes. Read more about the costs of bikes and breakdowns in our guide on <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>buying a motorbike in Vietnam</strong></a>.  When we put everything on the paper, we spent around 250,000 VND per day for our motorbikes (gas, maintenance and repairs).   When it comes to budgeting, the buses are a bit cheaper but offering faster transport. You can also travel during the night and sleep there (sleeper buses can be a very good option if you’re not taller than 170 cm).   It’s awesome as you can stop a bus everywhere on the road. Just stay on the road, wave to the bus driver and they will stop if they still have seats. Be sure to prepare Google Translate and don’t accept the first price if it doesn’t seem right. Bus drivers will usually overcharge you, but with little bargaining skills, you will get the fair price.  Prepare your phone with <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/mobile-apps-vietnam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>handy mobile apps</strong></a> that will make your trip around Vietnam much easier!  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4740\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.train-in-vietnam.jpg\" alt=\"Train in Vietnam\" width=\"968\" height=\"646\" />  Although buses are very convenient to come from A to B fast and safe, they won’t give you total freedom and amazing scenery you can experience driving a motorbike. The rides that are around 200 km will cost you around 100,000 - 250,000 VND.  Check out the <strong><a href=\"https://vexere.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">website</a> </strong>for timetables and detailed prices. For instance, Hanoi to Da Nang in a sleeper bus will cost you about 350,000 VND.  Trains are a bit more expensive and the rides are longer, but you’ll experience stunning scenery on every train drive. The price is a bit higher and you need to book a ticket a few days before as many locals tend to travel by train, especially at a longer distance.   For instance, the price from Da Nang (central Vietnam) to Saigon (South Vietnam) will cost you around 1,000,000 VND. Do the math and see what’s the best option for you! :)  Also, Vietnam is developing on a crazy fast pace, so almost every bigger city has its own domestic airport which means you can travel by planes between cities for a funny amount of money. For instance, Hanoi to Saigon can cost as low as $40. If you’re lacking the time, that’s the best option!   Don\'t forget to read our ultimate guide on <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/public-transportation-in-vietnam\"><strong>public transport in Vietnam</strong></a>. You can find out all the details, websites, prices and more for each mean of transportation.  Now you have many options on how to travel around Vietnam with different transportation options. It’s up to you to choose your way, but if you have enough time (one month), just go for a full adventure and pick a bike and do the whole Vietnam with the bike. That’s the experience you will always remember! :) <h2><b>Safety in Vietnam</b></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4736\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.safety-in-vietnam.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnam is pretty safe country\" width=\"1000\" height=\"649\" />  In general, Vietnam is one of the safest countries I’ve to have a chance to travel to. Through the journey of more than 1 year, driving the country twice, living in some crazy places, even <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/border-crossing-vietnam-laos-motorbike\"><strong>crossing to Laos by motorbike</strong></a>, I must say that I never felt in danger.   After doing comprehensive research on the internet, I can say that Vietnam is a relatively safe country, even for solo travelers, but just don’t forget to use your common sense.   Bigger cities like Saigon, Hanoi and Da Nang tend to have a higher rate of petty crimes, so keep your belongings near you all the time, especially when walking around busy and touristic places. There are many tourist traps in Vietnam, so don’t buy things you don’t need and don’t be sorry for people offering you many things. Their job is to make you feel sorry, so you just buy overpriced things you don’t need.  There are many <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam\"><strong>scams in Vietnam</strong></a> and so many tourists fall on cheap tricks!  The biggest safety issue in Vietnam is definitely traffic. Traffic is crazy and there is an enormous amount of motorbikes, trucks and buses on the road.   <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4737\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.safety2.jpg\" alt=\"Be extra careful on the roads\" width=\"971\" height=\"646\" />  Don’t hesitate to use your honk as much as possible. Be careful of buses and trucks as they usually drive like in the video games and they are always the fastest on the road. Sometimes, it seems like they don’t care about others so you\'d better move away from their way.  At first, the traffic will look very terrifying, especially if you\'ve never had a chance to drive in Asia. After some experience, you will see that people are used to the traffic and they know how to go with the flow with other people in traffic. Always be aware of every moving and non-moving object and don’t look too much around, especially when you’re driving around the cities.   I had a motorbike accident where I crashed into another motorbike in the city. Thank God, nothing serious happened and everyone was fine. People were extremely helpful and everything was sorted out in minutes. Just wanted to tell you that no matter how good your driving is, never get too confident or cocky on the roads. Always drive defensive and you will be fine! :) <h2><b>Get Ready for Stunning Motorbike Trip in Vietnam</b></h2> This was a huge guide of Vietnam, huh? You remembered that I told you to take a cup of coffee (or three) and find a comfortable place? Yeah, I think after reading this guide you will have a perfect idea what you can expect during your motorbike trip in Vietnam.

(12728, 3, '2019-07-02 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'Vietnamese people are very friendly, social and passionate when it comes to family, football, food and, of course, booze! Just a simple walk around the streets will give you the idea of a lively drinking scene in Vietnam. Wherever you are, there is a huge possibility you will hear <em>\'Mot, Hai, Ba, Yo!\'</em> shouted from dozens of men in the distance. That is the Vietnamese way to enjoy their booze and say cheers. The chances are huge that you\'ve heard for Bia Hoi a.k.a. a fresh beer before coming to Vietnam.   The beer culture and history are simply amazing. Bia Hoi is one of the most consumed alcoholic drinks in Vietnam. It’s dirt cheap, claimed to be fresh and made by local people. The beer itself contains around 3% alcohol, but it’s a very inaccurate measurement. Locals usually produce their beer in a non-regulated environment, so you never know what you get (it\'s worth the risk!).  We really enjoyed Bia Hoi and experience around it, so we\'re going to share everything we know about this fantastic drink. <h2><b>History of Bia Hoi </b></h2> <p id=\"KkakMEp\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4846 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d1adde22d4e3.jpg\" alt=\"Bia Hoi history\" width=\"907\" height=\"642\" /></p> Last century was tough and dynamic for Vietnam and its people since the country went through one of the longest wars in recent history. Vietnamese people always adapt to the situation, so they <em>\'invented\'</em> many goods during the hardships to make their life easier, and more enjoyable. One of the <em>\'inventions\'</em> is an iconic Bia Hoi - or fresh beer.  It all started at the end of the 19th century when French colonialists founded the first brewery named Hommel Brewery which was located on Hoang Hoa Tham. In the beginning, the beer was only for the elite since production was quite expensive and locals weren’t keen on drinking an alcoholic drink from colonialists. At that time, Vietnamese people were mainly producing and enjoying their rice wine!   The brewery’s output was very scarce counting just about 150 liters per day since it was serving only elite, mainly French people. In 1954., when the Vietnamese army won the French colonialists, they took over the brewery and renamed it to Hanoi Beverage Company. That was just a beginning of the shiny beer history in Vietnam!   At the end of the 50s, there were a few types of beer brewed by the company. However, the conflicts and complications arose, so the materials like glass and aluminum were expensive and scarce. People needed to figure out a different way of storing beer. Kegs were ideal as the beer could stay for an extended period without getting corrupted.   The moment when the beer started to be stored in the kegs was the birth of <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bia_h%C6%A1i\">Bia Hoi</a></strong> as we know today!  Still, at that time, Bia Hoi wasn’t a beloved drink of Vietnamese people since only a small portion of the population enjoyed that beverage, while the majority of the population stayed truthful to their beloved rice wine.   There was a shortage of rice during the 60s, so the leader, Ho Chi Minh, banned the production of alcoholic drinks from the rice. Rice was exclusively a food.   After that moment, Vietnamese people being alcoholic lovers, just gave a try to newly introduced Bia Hoi. That was the point of no return for the iconic fresh beer!  Today, you can see many people enjoying the sips of this historic beverage around the streets of Hanoi and Saigon while sitting on tiny red chairs and eating fresh peanuts.  <h2><b>Wait! What About the Glasses?</b></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-4847 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d1ade14aeae4.jpg\" alt=\"Bia Hoi glasses are made from recycled glass.\" width=\"975\" height=\"641\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Almost every pint for Bia Hoi is handmade!</div>  Since Bia Hoi is always stored in kegs and sometimes in plastic bottles, there was a massive demand for glasses. During the war, when Bia Hoi started to gain its popularity, materials were scarce, so Vietnamese people needed to be very creative while inventing the glasses!  People were drinking beer from glass pints from beginnings. It’s a tradition now, and many people refuse to drink from any other glasses. There is an <a href=\"https://e.vnexpress.net/news/video/the-story-behind-hanoi-s-40-year-old-bia-hoi-glass-3633585.html\"><strong>interesting story behind the imperfectly shaped glasses</strong></a>.  There are a few factories around North Vietnam that produce glasses for Bia Hoi. They collect and recycle the broken glass around the country. After recycling, the glass undergoes a heating process for roughly six hours and then shaped into a glass shape. Afterward, the cups were buried in the ash, so the process of cooling down isn\'t too rapid.   Almost every glass is hand-made, even today! That’s a crazy fact to know, especially when the consumption is crazy high, and demand for glasses is growing with every day.  <h2><b>Unbelievable Bia Hoi Facts You\'ve Never Heard Of!</b></h2> The history of Bia Hoi is fascinating, which means there are many unbelievable facts behind this favorite beverage.  <ul>   <li><strong>Cheapest beer in the world</strong><b> - </b>after extensive research and walking around the cities around Vietnam to help ourselves with a glass of delicious and cold fresh beer, we believe it’s the world’s cheapest beer. One cup of 0.4l costs from 3,000 - 5,000 VND on the street. Expect a good buzz for a couple of dollars! How crazy it is?</li>   <li><strong>Handmade cups made from recycled glass</strong> - even when the demand and consumption are at its highest point, the cups are handmade from recycled glass. Literally, a few families around North Vietnam run small family factories where the magic happens. They are the leading distributors of the Bia Hoi glasses in Vietnam!</li>   <li><strong>Birth of Bia Hoi</strong><b> - </b>it’s a very amazing story that goes behind making the first cup of fresh beer. Vietnamese people enjoy their alcohol and spending their time with beloved friends, but during the war, the drink of choice was rice wine. Since the shortage, the rice was banned for alcohol production, but it didn’t stop people from drinking. They just switched to a fresh beer and that’s how this drink becomes very popular today!</li>   <li><strong>Bottoms up</strong><b> - </b>Vietnamese people don’t mess around when it comes to beer! Their style of drinking hugely differs from drinking styles around the world. They drink their fresh beer usually bottoms up! If you ever drink with Vietnamese people, be prepared to get totally drunk since finishing beers in one sip was never a thing for just a casual meeting with friends!</li>   <li><strong>Snack goes very well with beer</strong><b> - </b>it’s hard to see anyone drinking beer without snacking! People usually eat fresh peanuts, spring rolls, fried chicken wings, dried chicken, or squid. Food is usually very spicy or goes with the chili which just makes you more thirsty for this magical beverage! Don\'t forget to try <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-street-food\"><strong>street food in Vietnam</strong></a> as it\'s the staple of Vietnamese culture.</li> </ul> <h2><b>Where to Drink Bia Hoi? </b></h2> <p id=\"gjkMBYB\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4848 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d1ade622d147.jpg\" alt=\"Places to drink Bia Hoi\" width=\"710\" height=\"535\" /></p> Finding a fresh beer place shouldn’t be a problem in some places, but still, it’s hardly possible to find it anywhere. Locals mainly consume fresh beer in North Vietnam as it originates from Hanoi.   The good news is that the majority of travelers lands in either Hanoi or Saigon (HCMC) and these two cities are full of Bia Hoi places! If it\'s your first time in Vietnam, be sure to prepare yourself for <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam\"><strong>dozens of culture shocks</strong></a>! <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Best Places to Drink Bia Hoi in Hanoi</b></h2> Bia Hoi originates from Hanoi, so it’s literally effortless to find a place to sit and drink. Alright, a place to sit can be tough to find since it’s usually filled with thirsty people.  There are many places, but the best experience is around the iconic Old Quarter area.   <b>Note: </b>We didn’t try all of these bars/places, but we found out a few places that people continuously mention by the excellence of the fresh beer, so we shared these places! <h3><b>Beer Corner</b></h3> That’s the busiest street when it comes to drinking. People started to call this location as a \'Beer street\' as once you start walking around you won’t see any other thing than beer, red chairs and a lot of spicy snacks. And yeah, you will hear a lot of cheers on Vietnamese every second!   One beer usually costs from 5,000 - 8,000 VND and it can be a tough thing to find a free chair to sit. Come there around 6 pm while Vietnamese people are enjoying dinner with their families.   The only downfall of the place (in our opinion) is that the place is totally spoiled and everyone wants to make money from the fresh beer. There are too many restaurants filled with drunk backpackers mainly. We usually skip these places that don’t provide with the authenticity of the culture.   <strong><em>Navigate Beer Corner on the map:</em></strong>  <iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3723.9474616180123!2d105.8499754152519!3d21.03478809294771!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x3135abbf606d13c5%3A0xc2c2ecf795f313c5!2sBeer+Corner!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1562039444551!5m2!1sen!2s\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe> <h3><b>Bia Hoi Restaurants</b></h3> If you’re not looking for a specific place to drink Bia Hoi, then Bia Hoi Ha Noi restaurants are perfect spots. These small, tiny local restaurants are located around the city. You can see the sign from the street and they are serving mainly fresh beer combined with simple local food that can go well with beer.   It’s worth the try and the beer is usually a bit cheaper than in the Old Quarter. Also, the main customers in these bars are locals which gives you a unique vibe while drinking there. Be prepared to get invited by locals to their table, or they will invite themselves to your table, and get few beers more than expected!  <h3><b>Bia Hoi Joint at 50 Bat Dan</b></h3> This one is a small street filled with dozen restaurants and bars on the street where mainly locals enjoy their fresh beer and local food. There are not many foreigners, so you can definitely experience a real and authentic culture of beer drinking in Vietnam.   The glass of a fresh beer will cost you from 3,000 - 5,000 VND on this place!  <strong><em>Navigate Bia Hoi Junction on the map:</em></strong>  <iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d755.1104575175598!2d105.84651131341067!3d21.03373811055136!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x3135abbdce047a47%3A0x79e0dc28dac9d55c!2sBia+Hoi+Ha+Noi!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1562039518509!5m2!1sen!2s\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe> <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Best Places to Drink Bia Hoi in Saigon (HCMC)</b></h2> Although the fresh beer originates from North Vietnam, it’s so popular around the country that can be easily found in Saigon too. The culture of drinking isn’t that huge like in Hanoi, but still, it’s not uncommon to see people crushing the beer until they can’t sit on the chairs anymore.   It’s very interesting information that the government occasionally bans Bia Hoi in Saigon since there are many reports of illness after consuming it. The biggest concern is the cleanness and quality of the beer since it’s easy to get spoiled, some people continue to sell it anyway. That makes a fresh beer kind of scarce in Saigon.   Anyway, there are a few known places where you can enjoy a favorite Vietnamese drink. <h3><b>Bia Sai Gon 73</b></h3> This small street bar is located in the middle of Bui Vien street - a backpackers’ street in Saigon. It’s hard to miss this place since it’s overpacked with people and tiny red and blue chairs. The majority of customers there are backpackers, but still, there are some locals too, so it’s a great way to socialize and meet new friends.   This bar offers few food selections which go well with the beer!   The price of the beer is a bit higher than in Hanoi and other places, so one glass will cost you 10,000 VND.   The place is a bit spoiled with tourists, but still, it’s a lively place that will definitely provide you with an amazing experience. It’s very hot there since they have only a few fans pointing to the people, so be prepared to drink a lot!   Is it a strategy or pure coincidence, let’s leave it to you to judge!   <em><strong>Navigate Bia Sai Gon on the map:</strong></em>  <iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d1156.9143863931663!2d106.69283599769393!3d10.76689976070551!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0xffdefb18a4a42382!2sBeer+102+Bui+Vien!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1562039623155!5m2!1sen!2s\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe> <h3><b>Bia Hoi Ha Noi</b></h3> This restaurant is a trendy choice for local people who enjoy delicious food combined with a fresh beer. The place isn’t thrown in the middle of hell like the previous place we mentioned, so the atmosphere is a bit more chilled and it provides you with more authentic experience.   The majority of clientele of this restaurant is the working class who wants to get relaxed after a hard day at work. They usually start to eat and drink around 6 pm and stay up to 11 pm. If you’re planning to visit or stay a bit longer, be prepared to get many toasts with locals! Just be ready for doing countless bottom ups with beers which will make even the most experienced drinker drunk!  The beer costs from 5,000 - 8,000 VND! <h2><b>How Safe is Bia Hoi?</b></h2> There are many discussions when it comes to the safety of fresh beer which is totally logical question since the majority of bia hoi is home brewed beer.   We tried fresh beer around Vietnam, in Hanoi, Saigon, Da Nang and even in the countryside and around the Highlands. We didn’t experience any problems while drinking. The only problem was a hungover, but it’s normal since we were usually drinking with locals who were insisting on finishing a beer in one sip. It just adds up after a few bottom ups!   After talking with some expats and travelers, we didn’t hear any negative experience about Bia Hoi, so it’s more than enough for us to say it’s totally safe to drink it.  Be responsible drinker and you’ll be fine! Maybe the morning headache will occur, but it’s normal when you’re drinking the low-quality alcohol without a known origin. Just enjoy and dip in the Vietnamese culture!   <hr />  Once you set your foot in Vietnam and get used to the climate, it’s time for exploration. If you really want to experience and immerse in the culture, then what could be a better way than checking local places and drink Bia Hoi with local people?

Luckily, there are many creative ways to get out of the city\'s routine and experience something new. Driving a Prao loop with a motorbike is a perfect getaway from a busy city (especially in a tourist season). The whole loop is about <strong>200 km long and can be easily done in one day</strong>.  I did a whole loop twice, both times in one day (wished that I\'ve had a bit more time to spend a night on the road). Prao loop is an extremely amazing and fun loop to drive since it features breathtaking passes, windy roads, beautiful mountains, wild rivers, green jungle, tiny villages and loads of rice fields.  Sounds like an ideal getaway from a noisy city? Perfect! Get your bike ready and prepare yourself for adventure.  Here\'s everything you need to know about the iconic Prao loop. <h2><strong>Where is Prao Loop and How to Start?</strong></h2> The whole loop is located in the heart of mountainous Quang Nam province bordering, on parts, with Da Nang city. If you\'re living in Da Nang, Hue or Hoi An (even Tam Ky), this might be a great way to immerse yourself in the extremely pleasant driving experience.  <em>I don\'t want to leave anything to your imagination, so here\'s the map:</em> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m42!1m12!1m3!1d245575.51460126368!2d107.78333973800574!3d15.902918427251013!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!4m27!3e0!4m5!1s0x314219c792252a13%3A0xfc14e3a044436487!2zRGEgTmFuZywgSOG6o2kgQ2jDonUgRGlzdHJpY3QsIERhIE5hbmc!3m2!1d16.0544068!2d108.20216669999999!4m5!1s0x3141dd98c11fdc5d%3A0x39a7dd0a7ccb4e80!2sPrao%2C+%C4%90%C3%B4ng+Giang%2C+Quang+Nam+Province%2C+Vietnam!3m2!1d15.927263199999999!2d107.6392892!4m5!1s0x316a083fc0000001%3A0x77501fc26e15a017!2zVGjhuqFuaCBN4bu5LCB0dC4gVGjhuqFuaCBN4bu5LCBOYW0gR2lhbmcgRGlzdHJpY3QsIFF1YW5nIE5hbSBQcm92aW5jZQ!3m2!1d15.7598408!2d107.8330254!4m3!3m2!1d15.9313773!2d108.1309448!4m3!3m2!1d16.0515214!2d108.2013715!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1562763864448!5m2!1sen!2s\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p> As I\'m currently living in Da Nang city, I hit the road from Da Nang. The first stop was a tiny town called Prao. After Prao, I\'ve followed the windy and mountainous road to Thanh My. From there I\'ve just followed the road through countless villages all the way to Da Nang.  <strong><em>There are a few possible routes to complete the Prao loop:</em></strong> <ul>   <li>Hoi An - Thanh My - Prao - Da Nang - Hoi An</li>   <li>Da Nang - Prao - Thanh Mi - Hoi An - Da Nang</li>   <li>Hue - Prao - Thanh My - Hoi An - Da Nang - Hue</li> </ul> Basically, it\'s totally up to you which route will you take. You can even widen the loop and do it all the way from Hue to Tam Ky (heard it\'s very nice, especially south of Thanh My).  The whole loop will take you a whole day (including rests and stops for stunning views). Start early in the morning as you\'ll want to reach Prao (or first stop) before noon. It\'s extremely hot in the mountains and the sun is so strong. <h2><strong>1st Section: Da Nang -&gt; Prao</strong></h2> If you\'re heading from Da Nang, the best (and fastest) option is to reach Cam Le district. Just stay on Nguyen Huu Tho street until you reach the bridge. Turn right and follow AH17 road all the way to a huge intersection with CT road. Please note that CT marked roads are new highways only for cars. After you pass the huge intersection you\'re going to turn the first right to Quang Xuong road that becomes QL14G later. You can\'t miss Prao once you\'re on that road since there is only one main road leading to Prao. Just stay and keep going.  The biggest struggle is getting out of the city as the road through Cam Le district is usually packed with container trucks. Once you get out of the main road, it becomes easier and more scenic to drive. On the way in the mountains, there are a few tourist attractions and water park so the first section of the road can be a bit busy from time to time. It\'s very funny to see the conditions of the road drastically changes for worse once you pass water park.  After a waterpark, you slowly continue to ascend and drive through beautiful passes. The road conditions aren\'t the best and there are many potholes, so be extremely careful. On the way to Prao, there are countless tiny villages, tea plantations and beautiful mountains on the horizon. It will take you around 2 hours to reach Prao and you might be frustrated from time to time because of road conditions, but don\'t worry as the real pleasure is following soon.  Once you reach Prao, there is nothing much going on. It\'s a small and quiet town in the middle of the Highlands. There are two main roads leading from the town. One to Laos border (north) and one to Thanh My (south). The main market is always noisy as usual, people have wedding parties over there. Just on the main road, there is a cozy cafe where you can refill your energy with a <strong><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide\">strong Vietnamese coffee</a></strong>. There are countless street restaurants serving delicious rice and noodles.  Also, if you decide to stay in Prao for a night and explore the surrounding area there are a few guest houses (Nha Nghi) on the main road. The average price for a room is 200,000 VND/night. Tay Giang is just 56 km away from Prao and it\'s a great place to visit and admire stunning views. Unfortunately, I didn\'t have time to visit this stunning place since it means staying in Prao for a night. <p id=\"BNHSues\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4878 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d25f4f3a91a0.jpg\" alt=\"Getting out of the city\" width=\"1029\" height=\"773\" /></p> <p id=\"rCmvfjH\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4879 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d25f516329fe.jpg\" alt=\"Getting in the mountains\" width=\"1035\" height=\"744\" /></p> <p id=\"awSArrz\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4880 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d25f53a3980a.jpg\" alt=\"First stunning mountainous pass\" width=\"1039\" height=\"754\" /></p> <p id=\"EwMRavm\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4881 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d25f555e78c5.jpg\" alt=\"Prao town on the main road\" width=\"1035\" height=\"759\" /></p> <p id=\"RCNzXNL\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4882 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d25f57e85ee7.jpg\" alt=\"Getting out of Prao town\" width=\"1029\" height=\"763\" /></p>  <h2><strong>2nd Section: Prao -&gt; Thanh My</strong></h2> You\'ve probably experienced some frustration on the road to Prao, right? Well, as I\'ve mentioned before, the real chunk of the loop is just coming. Prao to Thanh My is by far the most stunning part of the loop. Distance between these two towns is 56 km of pure pleasure. This is definitely in the top 5 roads in my opinion in the whole of Vietnam (I\'ve been driving for more than 30,000 km around the country).  At the very beginning, the road starts to ascend a bit leading you to the top of the surrounding mountain. After a short ascent, you\'ll start to descend through windy road surrounded by a beautiful valley and mountainous chain. The river is passing through the valley and it helps in making the electricity. There is really nothing much to say about the road and its conditions. I haven\'t experienced any potholes, the road is very wide, windy and empty. It\'s a great ride and you can get yourself a bit loose if you know what you\'re doing.  Thanh My, similar to Prao, lays on two main roads. One road leads to Da Nang (coast) while the other road leads to Kon Tum (Highlands). On the main road, you can find a few guest houses (200,000 VND/night) as well as local restaurants offering delicious food and drinks. My favorite spot is by far Nuoc Mia place with hammocks. There are a few places on the road where you can order a cold drink while resting in a hammock. It\'s just perfect to lay down a bit after a long, and uncomfortable drive (who drives Honda Wave knows!).  I don\'t want to write too much about the road and its surroundings as I believe pictures tell everything: <p id=\"KIEUafb\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4865 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d25f0732bf61.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful river on the way to Thanh My\" width=\"1040\" height=\"759\" /></p> <p id=\"hDqEmeT\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4866 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d25f09fc2eec.jpg\" alt=\"Mountains in a distance\" width=\"1040\" height=\"709\" /></p> <p id=\"xIlTNMQ\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4867 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d25f0ca81f85.jpg\" alt=\"Road and surrounding nature\" width=\"1038\" height=\"731\" /></p> <p id=\"xtQrqzv\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4868 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d25f1098e999.jpg\" alt=\"30 km away from Thanh My\" width=\"1040\" height=\"767\" /></p> <p id=\"GHDOpqv\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4869 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d25f14ddcc93.jpg\" alt=\"Stunning nature\" width=\"1042\" height=\"689\" /></p> <p id=\"tTfpsJS\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4870 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d25f18e2008b.jpg\" alt=\"Overlooking Thanh My\" width=\"1028\" height=\"672\" /></p>  <h2><strong>3rd Section: Thanh My -&gt; Da Nang</strong></h2> The last section isn\'t so iconic as a previous one but has its charm. The first 20 km are very beautiful as you\'ll stumble upon stunning mountains and passes, but after the first section, the road becomes narrow and busy. Pretty soon you\'ll reach tiny villages on the road with many restaurants and shops. The thing that I like the most about this section are corn and rice fields. It looks extremely beautiful when the sun sets over it. Be extra careful while driving on the road since there are only two tracks and the road is packed with trucks and cars who don\'t care much about anything that\'s smaller than them on the road.  Pretty soon you\'ll reach the big intersection with CT road from the beginning of Prao loop. It\'s the sign you\'re slowly getting back to the city. <p id=\"ghstrcc\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4871 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d25f1e140430.jpg\" alt=\"On the way back to Da Nang\" width=\"1032\" height=\"733\" /></p> <p id=\"IqDfxKN\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4873 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d25f25310ef1.jpg\" alt=\"Tiny village near Thanh My\" width=\"1029\" height=\"714\" /></p> <p id=\"yxHXcRn\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4874 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d25f2a1406a2.jpg\" alt=\"Corn fields in Quang Nam\" width=\"1032\" height=\"707\" /></p> <p id=\"zxoANwY\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4875 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d25f2cdba362.jpg\" alt=\"Local views\" width=\"1040\" height=\"721\" /></p> <p id=\"aSpqiQF\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4876 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d25f30706671.jpg\" alt=\"Bridge leading to Da Nang\" width=\"1031\" height=\"757\" /></p>  <h2><strong>Prao Loop is a Perfect Getaway From Da Nang City!</strong></h2> If you have your own motorbike and you love to drive, then hitting Prao loop is definitely a thing you have to do once. The whole loop will take a whole day, or even two, but the experience is totally worth the time. Pack enough water, prepare your motorbike, get some riding buddies and let\'s hit the road.  If you have any questions about the loop, please don\'t hesitate to ask. Also, we did an interesting write-up on <strong><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/son-tra-peninsula\">Son Tra Peninsula day trip</a></strong> that might be interesting if you\'re living in or around Da Nang city.

You\'ve visited all touristy spots in the city and explored a stunning nature surrounding the city and now, you\'re asking yourself is there anything more? Well, we\'ve asked ourselves this question countless times. What we did was very simple. Took a motorbike and ride around the city (including Quang Nam) to explore something new. Lately, we\'ve been very interested in exploring Da Nang waterfalls and lakes.  So far, we\'ve explored a few beautiful waterfalls and secluded lakes where you can easily spend a few days camping and relaxing. Believe us, you\'ll be surprised how many natural places you can find once you get out of the city and hit the countryside (we\'re going to write about these places soon).  For now, we\'d like to talk about Soui Mo Hoa Bac waterfall that\'s a perfect spot for a day trip. <h2><strong>How to Get to Suoi Mo Hoa Bac Waterfall?</strong></h2> This one is by far one of the best waterfalls in Da Nang we\'ve had a chance to explore. It\'s located just about an hour drive from the city. Getting there isn\'t so complicated, but as you get near the waterfall, be ready for some walking/driving through the jungle.  <em>To get a better understanding of its location, here are directions:</em> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m26!1m12!1m3!1d61338.08537535624!2d108.09993925468527!3d16.084661423056254!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!4m11!3e6!4m5!1s0x314219c792252a13%3A0xfc14e3a044436487!2zRGEgTmFuZywgSOG6o2kgQ2jDonUgRGlzdHJpY3QsIERhIE5hbmc!3m2!1d16.0544068!2d108.20216669999999!4m3!3m2!1d16.1388836!2d108.073346!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1563198180135!5m2!1sen!2s\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p> No matter where are you starting from, to reach a waterfall you drive in the direction of Hai Van Pass. There are basically two main ways to reach Hai Van Pass - QL1A or Nguyen Tat Thanh Street. We recommend avoiding a busy QL1A as there are hundreds of traffic lights on the way and traffic can be very dangerous since that\'s the road massive containers and buses take.  Nguyen Tat Thanh, on the other hand, has only a few traffic lights and offers an iconic view on Hai Van, beautiful sandy beach and wide road. At the end of the street, you\'re going to connect to QL1A (you can\'t avoid it), but traffic isn\'t that crazy anymore like through the city.  Continue to follow QL1A until you pass Cau Nam O. After the bridge, you should take the first left turn (Ngo Xuan Thu). Just stay on the road and enjoy the view!  The road and its surrounding scenery are beautiful. You\'ll follow the river, paddy fields and stunning mountains in a distance.  <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4898 \" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.path.jpg\" alt=\"Path to Soui Mo Waterfall\" width=\"634\" height=\"845\" />  <strong><em>Once you get to the marked location, there are two options:</em></strong> <ul>   <li>you leave the bike (there is a small abandoned house) and walk to the waterfall (around 20 minutes walk)</li>   <li>or you drive the bike all the way to waterfall (there is a path full of rocks and it can be tough to drive)</li> </ul> We did both. The first time, we walked as it seemed there is no way we could drive our bikes up there. Once we reached the waterfall area, people told us to get the bike here as there were some bike stealing recently. We returned back for the bike and drove it all the way through a bumpy road full of stones. Not the most comfortable drive, but better be safe than sorry.  The whole way is paved as the waterfall is mainly visited by locals who have nhau there. We went during the weekend and the waterfall was packed with locals enjoying foods and drinks. It wasn\'t crowded and you can find the place to have a whole waterfall for yourself. <h2><strong>Handy Tips for Visiting Suoi </strong><strong>Mo Hoa Bac Waterfall</strong></h2> We\'ve randomly decided to visit one of the most beautiful Da Nang waterfalls, so the preparation was almost unexistent. However, after the trip to this stunning waterfall, here are some handy tips that will make your trip better: <ul>   <li>take enough water, snacks, drinks as this place is perfect for relaxing for a whole day</li>   <li>not advisable to go after the rainy period since the paved road will be hard or impossible to pass</li>   <li>drive your motorbike all the way to the waterfall (there is a security guy who\'ll watch over your bike for 10,000 VND)</li>   <li>don\'t forget to apply a sunscreen</li>   <li>don\'t hand over any trash to a security guy as he will just throw everything in the river</li> </ul> That would be it! The whole trip is around 30 km and it takes about one hour to reach the waterfall. There are plenty a few pools of crystal clear water and cliffs for jumping. Enjoy your day trip to one of the most beautiful Da Nang waterfalls.  <strong><em>Here are some photos from our day trip:</em></strong>  <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4897 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.greenery.jpg\" alt=\"Stunning greenery all around\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4899 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.valley.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful green valey\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4900 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.waterfall1.jpg\" alt=\"A way to waterfall\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4901 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.waterfall2.jpg\" alt=\"Suoi Mo waterfall\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4902 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.waterfall3.jpg\" alt=\"People enjoying their time at waterfall\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4896 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.chill.jpg\" alt=\"Plenty of room to relax \" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" /> <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Have you ever been to any of Da Nang waterfalls?

(12731, 2, '2019-07-20 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'Da Nang is slowly, but surely becoming the main touristic destination in Vietnam. Last year alone, Da Nang hosted more than <a href=\"http://vietnamtourism.gov.vn/english/index.php/items/13634\">7.5 million tourists</a> and tourism experts predict more than 8 million tourists this year. The city is going through major development and many people ask the same question - when is the best time to visit Da Nang?  Since Da Nang features a monsoon season, it\'s important to plan your visit accordingly. The city has two parts - a beachside and city center. The east side is known for tourism, chilled expat community, stunning sandy beach and <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/son-tra-peninsula\">Son Tra peninsula</a>. On the other hand, a city center features a local vibe, museums, delicious and diverse food and extremely friendly locals.  I am going to go through weather statistics and explain different seasons in Da Nang. After that, I will share my experience with seasons since I\'ve been living in Da Nang for 11 months. Let\'s plan your trip to Da Nang together. <h2><strong>Seasons in Da Nang</strong></h2> Da Nang has a monsoon climate and distinct between two seasons - wet and dry season. Officially, a dry season starts from January all the way to the beginning of September. Wet season takes place from September to early January.  Since Da Nang features a tropical, or monsoon climate, the rainfall through the year is significant, especially during the wet season. <p id=\"wnJzrSx\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4919 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d31c137710f9.jpg\" alt=\"Average rainfall and temperatures in Da Nang\" width=\"921\" height=\"691\" /></p> On the graph above you can see the amount of rainfall in Da Nang in 2017. The red line represents the average temperature for each month. You can notice that rainfall significantly increases in September and peaks in October. February is the first month of the dry season with low rainfall.  The average yearly temperature (2017.) was 25.7°C. Temperatures start to rise from the middle of March and peaking through June and July.  Don\'t forget to check detailed <a href=\"https://www.weather-atlas.com/en/vietnam/da-nang-climate\">weather statistics of Da Nang</a>. <h2><strong>Best Time to Visit Da Nang?</strong></h2> <p id=\"YZnoowm\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4937 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d32c984aad4a.jpg\" alt=\"Da Nang rooftop view\" width=\"1330\" height=\"714\" /></p> Da Nang is widely popular by its sandy coast, lovely city center radiating with a local vibe, stunning surrounding nature, friendly people and much more. Majority of tourists who\'re visiting Da Nang come here mainly because of beaches and nature which is partly a reason why Da Nang is extremely busy during dry season.  Tet holiday falls on the first week of February and that\'s the time when the city is literally empty since people move to <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/tet-holiday-vietnam\">celebrate Tet holiday</a> with their families (usually countryside). The temperatures around that time averages around 22°C which results in chilly days and cold nights. From the beginning of March, temperatures slowly start to rise while rainfall decreases.  Based on our experience and statistical data, it\'s safe to say that the <strong>best time to visit Da Nang is anytime between March and August</strong>. <h2><strong>Budget &amp; Prices Through Seasons</strong></h2> Da Nang, compared to other big cities like Hanoi and Saigon features the quite lower cost of living during the year. As the city thrives from tourism, it\'s easy to understand why the prices are seasonal. Food and drink prices usually stay the same, but rental prices skyrocket when the tourist season kicks in.  January to March is the perfect time to visit Da Nang if you\'re on a budget. The accommodation options are abundant and the prices are slightly lower compared to the upcoming dry season. You can also bargain since the market is huge, but the demand isn\'t so. Prices of everything starts to rise around April all the way to August. In September, the prices start to normalize again. <p id=\"RCjrAyK\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4938 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d32cbe4de723.jpg\" alt=\"Beachside road in Da Nang\" width=\"1330\" height=\"709\" /></p> Da Nang has many options when it comes to accommodation including hostels, hotels, resorts, guest houses and homestays. If you\'re a budget traveler, hostels are affordable all year round. You can find some cozy and social hostels in the city center for as low as 50,000 VND per night. On the other side of the city (beachside) hostels are a bit more expensive with an average price of 80,000 VND per night.  We loved to stay in Fedora hostel that is near the airport. The night with included breakfast costs 89,000 VND. The staff is extremely friendly, the rooms are comfortable and quiet, plus the rooftop view is just amazing. (We\'re not affiliated with the hostel in any way, nor we earn any money mentioning the place. Just a friendly recommendation for a place we love to stay in!)  Apartment prices tend to rise too. I stayed in the apartment for around 6 months and the price was about 20% lower during the wet season. It happens mainly on the beachside of the city since it\'s the place where tourists flock in. If you\'re living for a longer period, it\'s recommended to figure out the prices through tourist season with the landlord and put everything in the contract. <p id=\"NNOerqm\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4939 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d32cc6053b70.jpg\" alt=\"Fresh beer in Da Nang\" width=\"1141\" height=\"846\" /></p> Prices for food &amp; drinks usually stay the same, but it\'s important to avoid tourist spots if you\'re on the budget. For instance, a sugar cane juice (nuoc mia) on the local/regular street costs 5,000 - 8,000 VND, but for the same drink, you\'ll pay about 20,000 VND near the beach or in city center\'s tourist area.  It doesn\'t seem a lot, but believe us, these small costs add up very fast and burn your budget. Be aware of your budget and spend your money accordingly. <h2><strong>Personal Experience &amp; Recommendation</strong></h2> I\'ve been living in Da Nang for the past 11 months and visited the city countless times before finally deciding to move here. Here\'s my personal experience that might help you while planning your visit to Da Nang. <h3><strong>August - November</strong></h3> <p id=\"KCAstKw\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4940 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d32ccca83a7d.jpg\" alt=\"Beach in the fall\" width=\"1163\" height=\"856\" /></p> The first time I\'ve arrived in Da Nang was August and the weather couldn\'t be better. We drove from the rainy north and finally had sunshine and stunning beach in front of us. The tourist season was still in high gear, the place was filled with tourists, but we decided to stay in Thanh Khe district which is a local place. The vibes were great and prices were local.  Weather in September starts to change introducing occasional rain and storms, but it\'s still good to hit a beach on a daily basis. October is also a very good month for swimming and driving around, but everything changes from the beginning of November. Temperatures were still around 23°C, but the weather started to be unstable with constant daily showers/storms/rains.  If you\'re looking to have a great time when you still can hit the beach every day, we recommend visiting Da Nang from the end of August to the beginning of October. There are not so many tourists around and the prices start to drop. The perfect period for budget travelers. <h3><strong>December - March</strong></h3> <p id=\"TntOOGj\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4941 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d32cd03a1293.jpg\" alt=\"Rainy season in Da Nang\" width=\"1146\" height=\"803\" /></p> December and early January are probably the worst months to be in Da Nang. The constant rain, cold weather and floods are the part of daily life. There was huge flooding that devastated the city center at the beginning of December. I remember that for a week I couldn\'t move out of the apartment. This period is ideal if you want to spend time in cafes while focusing on the projects. During that period, I\'ve explored quite a bit cafes around the city and come up with a list of the <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/working-cafes-in-da-nang\">best working cafes in Da Nang</a>.  Around the beginning of February, the weather becomes a bit more stable, but it\'s still chilly outside. People wear long sleeves while driving and nights can be cold. Locals love to say that the summer starts to kick in after Tet holiday and it was a really accurate statement. From the middle of February, the weather starts to stabilize, with constant sunny days and even a beach time. The water was a bit cold for swimming, but if you prefer a cold swim, then it\'s a good time for you.  March to April are good months to visit since the weather is amazing and the prices are still the same as during the wet season. <h3><strong>April - August</strong></h3> <p id=\"lvSZTJO\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4942 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d32cd55f014f.jpg\" alt=\"My Khe beach during dry season.\" width=\"994\" height=\"741\" /></p> This period is known as a dry season and it\'s the start of a tourist season. During April, prices started to rise, especially in the beachside area. The constant developing is a part of life during that time. Tourists start to flock in, and you can experience it in the traffic. The price of my apartment rose for a whopping 20% in April.  Anyway, the weather is extremely stable and I don\'t remember if there were a few consecutive days of rain. I can probably count rainy days from April to July on my hands. It\'s really great time to be in Da Nang. Even if you\'re a budget traveler, you can enjoy Da Nang during the peak season as the total cost of your trip won\'t exceed 20%.  This period is ideal for exploring the surrounding area. We\'ve explored beautiful <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/da-nang-waterfalls\">waterfalls in Da Nang</a> and drove <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/prao-loop\">Prao Loop</a>.  Be extra cautious when visiting touristic places as street vendors tend to pull scams on tourists (like in every touristic place). We\'ve written a huge list of <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam\">scams in Vietnam</a> we\'ve experienced during our 2 years in the country. <h2><strong>So When to Visit Da Nang?</strong></h2> <p id=\"MFJxjUh\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4943 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d32cdc8a52d5.jpg\" alt=\"Three Croatian guys on a rooftop\" width=\"656\" height=\"605\" /></p> Basically, it totally depends on your preferences and budget. Probably the main reasons for visiting Da Nang are beautiful beaches, relaxation and generally having a great time. We recommend avoiding anytime between the middle of November to the middle of February.  September to November and March to April tend to be amazing for budget travelers. Expect to pay at least 20% more for the whole trip if you\'re visiting between April and August. It\'s still affordable, even for budget backpackers.  <strong>Best time to visit Da Nang - April to August.</strong>  Now when you know when to plan your trip to Da Nang, head over to our detailed <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/3-days-in-da-nang\">3 days in Da Nang itinerary</a> and plan your activities.', 'When is the Best Time to Visit Da Nang?', 'TODO: Write Excerpt\r\n', 'draft', 'open', 'open', '', '', '', '', '2019-07-20 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', 0, 'http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/?p=12731', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Seeing Saigon from air and circling around the city around the Mekong delta is an amazing sight. We arrived at the Tân Sơn Nhat Airport really, really sleepy. Now, we just had to complete the bureaucratic procedure and get on exploring Saigon! This procedure can take quite a bit of time if there is a crowd in the lines.  <em>We have a <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-tourist-visa\"><strong>Vietnam tourist visa 101 guide</strong></a> for you just here!</em>  Also, a thing on notice, we bought <strong>SIM cards for 10 USD</strong> with a download speed of 1.2 Mbps.  After exiting the airport, we got hit with that recognizable scent of a Vietnamese metropolis, a combination of wet, smell from the river, gasoline, and food. A really unique combination. Really glad to be back in Vietnam! At the first moment we got out of the airport, we were approached by a guy who was claiming to be a Grab driver. He offered us a ride to our accommodation for 500.000 VND which is three time more than the regular Grab drive.  <em><strong>Pro tip:</strong> bargain <strong>all the time</strong>, and don’t make deals from the first offer in Vietnam!</em>  Also, Grab doesn\'t work the best! It is essentially a more popular (and cheaper) alternative to Uber in Vietnam. Combined with language barrier and a shoddy location service, expect to sometimes wait in vain while your Grab driver is wondering where are you. Basically mutual wondering what is going on that costs you both time.  <em>We have a guide on <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/mobile-apps-vietnam\"><strong>best mobile applications while exploring Saigon</strong></a>!

Once you see a guy riding a fridge 5 times bigger than him, vertically, on his motorbike, and actually balancing that stuff; you start to wonder again!  <img class=\"wp-image-4955 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0109.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the organized mess.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Inside the organized mess.</em></div>  Once we arrived at our accommodation in District 2, Antonio came inside 15 minutes later.

I really missed this fresh food with excellent taste combinations! After getting our food fix, we got some freshly made sugar cane juice and continued on to our rooftop!  <img class=\"wp-image-4957 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0159.jpg\" alt=\"This is Pho Bo, a rice noodle soup with beef.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>This is Pho Bo, a rice noodle soup with beef.</em></div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-4958\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0163.jpg\" alt=\"Enjoying Com Ram Bo, a delicious fried rice dish with vegetables and beef meat.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Enjoying Com Ram Bo, a delicious fried rice dish with vegetables and beef meat.</em></div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-4959\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0166.jpg\" alt=\"Nuoc Mia, sugar cane juice, being prepared.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Nuoc Mia, sugar cane juice is being prepared.</em></div>  The rooftop is bloody amazing to say at least!

After smoking a doobie or two and just having a fantastic time listening to AJ stand-uppin\' in comedy, we fainted in our beds after almost 2 days of not sleeping.  <em>Find out more about <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/weed-in-saigon\"><strong>weed in Saigon!</strong></a></em>  We woke up in 10PM and decided to find some food. What I forgot is that the bustling, motorbike-horn spamming vibe in the cities dies off after 10PM. After looking all over our neighborhood, we found a decent place to eat Mi Xao for some 60.000 VND (that is a bit over 2 USD).  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-4961\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0208.jpg\" alt=\"Almost empty Saigon streets at night.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Almost empty Saigon streets at night.</em></div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-4962\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0235.jpg\" alt=\"Mi Xao Bo is a fried rice noodle dish with lots of vegetables and beef meat. \" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Mi Xao Bo is a fried rice noodle dish with lots of vegetables and beef meat.</em></div>  <img class=\"wp-image-4963 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0253.jpg\" alt=\"A friendly dog is seemingly part of the staff.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>A friendly dog is seemingly part of the staff.</em></div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-4964\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0280.jpg\" alt=\"Food usually gets served with soy sauce and chilli.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Food usually gets served with soy sauce and chili.</em></div>  We returned to our rooftop, jumped in the swimming pool, and realized it was already morning!

The raincoats cost 200.000 VND each, and I also borrowed one of the helmets.  Saigon traffic is really crazy! Once Antonio and I got on the main street, we were riding through holes and labyrinthian passages of buses and cars. Bikes contest to get into their sweet spots.

Sometimes you feel like a small ant in the heavy traffic in Saigon.</em></div>  There weren’t any Yamaha Nuovo bikes, but there was SYM Atilla bike for 7.000.000 VND and Yamaha Sirius for 9.000.000 VND. I tried out the Atilla but realized that I would need something different for the roads of Cambodia.  After checking out the first shop, we had another agreement deeper inside District 25. The rain started pouring even more, and we got there with a Grab drive while Antonio followed us on his bike.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5002\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0532.jpg\" alt=\"An actual car is great for rain protection!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>An actual car is great for rain protection!</em></div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5003\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0546.jpg\" alt=\"Rain makes for some awesome neon lights shots!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Rain makes for some awesome neon lights shots!</em></div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5004\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0540.jpg\" alt=\"The traffic in Saigon continues regardless of heavy rain.

The things just get more dangerous in these conditions, but, it\'s perfectly normal!</em></div>  The second seller wasn’t around, so we took a walk around to see if there are more places to find bikes. We found a place that was selling a lot of bikes between 4.000.000 VND and 12.000.000 VND. The owner of the shop also knew very good English and was really lighthearted with the bargaining jokes.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5001\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0566.jpg\" alt=\"The happiness when your workplace is inside and the poor sods are out there on the downpour.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>The happiness when your workplace is inside and the poor sods are out there on the downpour.</em></div>  Another arrangement with Saigon Motorcycles was waiting, so we decided to check that option out again. The owner called us a Grab, and we drove through the rainy and heavy traffic back to our neighborhood, with Antonio following the car again.  This time, we got to try two newer Yamaha Nuovo models. Some of them need some patching up, but the driving conditions are reasonable for now. When you consider the prices that are between 5.000.000 VND and 8.000.000 VND, it’s a good deal! The bikes also have phone holders, which can be quite useful for road trips in Vietnam. We agreed to come back tomorrow morning to check out the patched up bikes and make the final decision.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-4993\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0607.jpg\" alt=\"Finishing the day with some tasty Com Ram Bo!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Finishing the day with some tasty Com Ram Bo!</em></div>  There is still some of the night left to relax and get back to the world of remote work a bit.  <em>To get up to date, <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/motorbikes-in-saigon\"><strong>check out the previous chapter!</strong></a></em> <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Liked the post?

Jet lag can induce this in the first days of switching 5 time zones. AJ came around our apartment and we chilled a bit on the rooftop. Daytime view over the Saigon skyline and Landmark 81 is simply jaw-dropping!  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-4977\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0332.jpg\" alt=\"Cruising around on Honda Wave.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Cruising around on Honda Wave.</em></div>  We realized that we should find something to eat real fast.

Saigon Motorcycles was our first stop. The owner there is an older Vietnamese woman that surprisingly knows very good English! She has lots of bike gear in her shop, including helmets and raincoats, which are pretty much essential.   <img class=\"wp-image-4980 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0356.jpg\" alt=\"Crossing the street in Vietnam can be sometimes challenging.

It is also quite cheap, some 15.000 VND.  <img class=\"wp-image-4981 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0360.jpg\" alt=\"This is a Banh Mi street stall.

Trust me, it is absolutely phenomenal. Definitely on my top 3 coffee list! This sweet and creamy taste combined with a slight bitterness is just </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pizzicato!</i>  So good that we actually took two cups of coffee which energized us even further!  <img class=\"wp-image-4982 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0387.jpg\" alt=\"Sweet and tasty Vietnamese coffee.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Sweet and tasty Vietnamese coffee.</em></div> <h2><strong>Relaxing on the rooftop</strong></h2> We returned to our apartment at the evening.

Swimming pool is also really nice in this hour.   <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4985\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0423.jpg\" alt=\"Relaxing on the rooftop.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" />  <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4986\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0429.jpg\" alt=\"Chill by the pool.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" />  <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4987\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0448.jpg\" alt=\"Swimming in the pool.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" />  At one point, me and Lovel went to buy some snacks to the 7/11 store. It was a really long walk. We met a girl called Đurđa halfway through. She comes from Montenegro and lives in Saigon for almost a year and a half. It was a \"small world, eh?\" moment for sure. She confirmed to us where is the store and we continued on.  After chilling out some more on the rooftop of our accommodation, we decided that it was a high time to go to sleep. We still have to check out other alternatives for bikes tomorrow. After all, there are a lot of motorbikes in Saigon!  <em>To get up to date, <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/exploring-saigon\"><strong>check out the previous chapter!</strong></a></em> <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Liked the post?

Today, it is time to get the bikes that we checked yesterday at Saigon Motorcycles shop. Before we went to buy the bikes, we tasted awesome barbecue, egg and rice combination.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5031\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.rice-egg.jpg\" alt=\"The delicious combination of rice, egg and beef.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The delicious combination of rice, egg and beef.</div>  So, regarding the bikes. I bought Yamaha Nuovo 3, got a free helmet with a visor (Royal brand, not the best, but the visor is a godsend!), a luggage rack and a phone holder. All of that, for <strong>5.2 million VND!</strong> Lovel gave <strong>9.2 million VND</strong> for Yamaha Nuovo 4 and Darian gave<strong> 8 million VND.</strong>  <em>Here is all the information you will need on <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam\"><strong>buying a motorbike in Vietnam!</strong></a></em>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5032\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.mechanic.jpg\" alt=\"The final check at the mechanic.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The final check at the mechanic.</div>  Finally, a new mode of transportation allowed us to explore some more. We rode to Thao Dien market and got some juicy fruit!  We planned to visit the \'village inside of Saigon\', Thanh Da; which was the first serious route to test the skills in the crazy Vietnamese traffic. It is a lot easier than the first time, as I got used to keep with the flow of the traffic there, whether crazy that may sound.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5033\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.saigon-streets.jpg\" alt=\"The wet streets of Saigon.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The wet streets of Saigon.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5038\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.porsche-rain.jpg\" alt=\"A random Porsche cruising in the rain.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A random Porsche cruising in the rain.</div> <h2>Exploring the Ben Thanh Market</h2> After cruising through the village, we rode to <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293925-d311087-Reviews-Ben_Thanh_Market-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html\"><strong>Ben Thanh Market</strong></a> to check it out. It is a huge market, filled with many different stalls. You name it, they have it. Lots of jewelry, wristbands, watches, clothes, and food! I was more interested in photographing the flow of the market rather than buying something though.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5036\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.ben-thanh-labyrinth.jpg\" alt=\"Entering the labyrinth inside the Ben Thanh Market.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Entering the labyrinth inside the Ben Thanh Market.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5035\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.vietnamese.jpg\" alt=\"This Vietnamese guy was really uplifted to be the star of the portrait!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> This Vietnamese guy was really uplifted to be the star of the portrait!</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5037\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.market-bargaining.jpg\" alt=\"Make sure to bargain on the Ben Thanh Market!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Make sure to bargain on the Ben Thanh Market!</div>  As it was already evening, we went to the same food place to eat dinner. On the way to the restaurant, Antonio got a slight breakdown on his bike, so he had to push the bike rest of the way. Funny observation, whether you get a motorbike breakdown in the middle of Saigon, some local will most likely help you with boosting you!  Also, buying smoking paper is really challenging in Saigon. Best bets are some alternative-looking bars, as VinMart and 7/11 usually don\'t have them (some do, but it\'s a hit or miss situation).  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5039\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.saigon-night.jpg\" alt=\"Saigon at night has a charming neon vibe.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Saigon at night has a charming neon vibe.</div>  Anyway, late night was reserved for relaxation and hanging out with AJ before we depart for Cambodia.

We left the bike at the Xe May and continued with my bike through the crazy traffic of Saigon to Ben Thanh. Around the market, there is a gold shop which is essentially an exchange shop.  After getting USD for our trip, we stopped at one Banh Mi stall by one of the busy streets. There, we had some awesome Banh Mi for 30k VND, with eggs, chili and soy sauce, and more meat! This Banh Mi was served by a woman who is seemingly pregnant, assisted by her daughter.  Seemingly unnoticeable, a big problem in Vietnam is <strong>\'child assistance\'</strong>. To earn more money from their local food businesses; parents usually do not send their children to school because they need a helping hand, which essentially robs them of proper education. <h2>Packing up and Ready to Go!</h2> Now that we have returned to the apartment, it was time to say pack up and depart for Cambodia. AJ came around to wish us luck and we were on our way! We decided to slice the route to Phnom Penh in half and stay in Neak Loeung.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5053\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.biker.jpg\" alt=\"The biker crew is ready to hit the road to Cambodia!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The biker crew is ready to hit the road to Cambodia!</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5054\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.buddha.jpg\" alt=\"Channeling positive energy for the trip!\" width=\"523\" height=\"1024\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Channeling positive energy for the trip!</div>  Riding out of Saigon wasn\'t such a breeze. It is a huge city with 8 million registered inhabitants, so traversing on the main roads there is really chaotic. Lots of trucks and cars block out the way for the bikes, creating labyrinthian alleyways inside one huge road. When we finally got out of Saigon, we were greeted by heavy rain and storm which prompted us to stop before Cu Chi Tunnels.  <em><strong>Fun fact:</strong> Cu Chi is a place where you can visit the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Củ_Chi_tunnels\"><strong>Cu Chi Tunnels</strong></a>, that were built during the French Colonial period, but also were used in the Vietnamese War.</em>  After eating some much-needed food and drinking coffee with free tea (and hitting my head on the low ceiling numerous times), it was time to continue to Meo Vac border pass.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5058\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190729_165626.jpg\" alt=\"Just at the right place to wait out the heavy rain!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Just at the right place to wait out the heavy rain!</div> <h2>Moc Bai Border Crossing</h2> Once we arrived at the border pass it all went like a breeze! At least on the Vietnamese side. You park your bike in front of the processing building. You give your passport for the exit stamp, walk to the security officer that will check the stamp, and you\'re free to go to the Cambodian side of the border.  The things are a bit different on this side of the border. First thing, you will be greeted by a few men who claim to be visa officers. They will look for your passports and fill out the form for entrance into Cambodia. Visa costs <strong>35$</strong>, while the processing fee (after handing out the pictures) is 5$. So, the tourist visa for 30 days stay in Cambodia costs 40$. The procedure for getting the stamp is really easy, you just walk in the building, hand out the passport, and off you go!  Oh, we made a little mistake and left the helmets to the \'visa officers\' to look out for. When we wanted the go, one of the men didn\'t want to give Antonio\'s helmet back. He said he wants 10$ for coffee. In the end, we gave him 90k VND (which is almost 4,5$) and off we go! Remember to bargain in scam situations too! And watch out where you leave your things, to avoid these kinds of situations!  <em>Make sure to check out our <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/visa-run-vietnam\"><strong>Vietnam visa run guide</strong></a> for more information on border passes!</em> <h2>Officially in Cambodia!</h2> Once we passed the border town that has a huge casino, we realized the difference between Vietnam and Cambodia. The road here is very, very bad; lots of dust, no pavement and lots of holes. This can be an overkill for an automatic motorbike. Also, this road feels like Wild West, at one point there was no right side of the road. Everyone was just buzzing in their spots.  Eventually, we stopped on the road to ask for gas. A whole family popped out of their home and were staring at us with huge curiosity. They gave us a few liters of gas (1$ for 1 liter) and we were on our way to Neak Loeung.  We were immensely hungry on our way there and stopped at one family roadside restaurant. When we got there, it was really hard to communicate what we want to eat. At first, we got beer; after trying to communicate with at least 3 more people, we managed to order rice, vegetables, and beef combo. A guy who spoke good English helped us a bit too on that front. After refreshing for the rest of the trip, we continued to Neak Loeung. So, the <strong>language barrier in Cambodia is a thing</strong> too; it is a smart thing to learn some basic phrases for ordering food and drinks.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5055\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0815.jpg\" alt=\"Cambodia has dogs on every corner.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Cambodia has dogs on every corner.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5057\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0821.jpg\" alt=\"You will find these little Buddhist shrines all over Cambodia!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> You will find these little Buddhist shrines all over Cambodia!</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5056\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0820.jpg\" alt=\"Offerings to the shrine.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Offerings to the shrine.</div>  The road to Neak Loeung is dark, with no lighting except the motorbike light. Of course, there are a lot of holes and flies flying straight into your head, but the helmet visor does a good job on that front. Cars and trucks drive like crazy, and noticing them shouldn\'t be a huge problem. On the way to Neak Loeung are a few villages that we\'re sleeping in this time of night.  As the ride was already taking us 9 hours, we stopped for an occasional break to stretch out. At one of such stops, a small snake popped out under Antonio\'s bike and wouldn\'t move. As Antonio has a sort of snake-o-phobia, he jumped away from his bike. Eventually, we managed to scare away the snake with a few rocks and continue to Neak Loeung.  After some 10 and a half hours of riding, we finally came to our accommodation. I was extra tired, so I just blacked out in my bad. Lovel and Darian had a very, very fun night...

The ambiance looks like I\'ve been transported a decade or two in the past. Some scenes remind of a Wild West ambiance. Dusty roads and wooden houses further enhance that vibe. Ordering food from the locals here is wonky if you don\'t know the phrases. Also, the locals love to group up and just stare at us and make unknown comments. It\'s a fun experience!  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5077\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190730_143840.jpg\" alt=\"Neak Loeung main square is by all means patriotic.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Neak Loeung main square is by all means patriotic.</div>  It is good to remember that in the rural part of Cambodia, English is not spoken that much; so it is essential to learn a few Khmer phrases! After managing to order some tasty food, we found a place to sit and drink coffee. The coffee place also looks very run-down, like a saloon; but the warm smile of the beautiful lady makes up for it. And the coffee is awesome too! After relaxing and observing the flow of the market in front of the saloon, we went to the gas station to fill up our bikes.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5079\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190730_151354.jpg\" alt=\"Observing the flow of the Neak Loeung market.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Observing the flow of the Neak Loeung market.</div>  Buying at the local gas station can be a chore, as there was no specified price on board, so the vendor could put out the price he wished. The thing is, you need to bargain in this situation if you don\'t want to get ripped off (compared to the more \'modern\' gas stations).  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5078\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190730_161126.jpg\" alt=\"Bargaining at the gas station.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Bargaining at the gas station.</div>  Finally, after filling up our bikes with much-needed gas, it was time to ride the second slice of the path to Phnom Penh. To exit the town, we had to pass the longest bridge in all of Cambodia, spanning 2 kilometers. We stopped for a while an awed at the majestic Mekong River and the surrounding coastline. Words cannot express how beautiful a sight that is!  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5080\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_7874.jpg\" alt=\"Staring into the flow of the majestic Mekong.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Staring into the flow of the majestic Mekong.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5081\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_7875.jpg\" alt=\"Mekong is very important to Cambodian economy.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Mekong is very important to Cambodian economy.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5082\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_7880.jpg\" alt=\"The crew enjoying the wonderful sight!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The crew enjoying the wonderful sight!</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5083\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_7881.jpg\" alt=\"The fields in the Mekong basin stretch as far as eye can see.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The fields in the Mekong basin stretch as far as eye can see.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5084\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_7882.jpg\" alt=\"Lovel with his iconic \'L-movement\'.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Lovel with his iconic \'L-movement\'.</div>  Fast forward 20 kilometers, we stopped at a roadside restaurant to get a refreshment and a warm meal. Finally, we managed to communicate with a lady that we want beef and rice. Inside a restaurant was an ecstatic old man who recognized Croatian football players. He said that \'Kampuchea and Croatia friends forever!\'. A really warm welcome. He was even escorting us to our bikes just across the restaurant and gave us each a hug. We continued to Phnom Penh afterward.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5085\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_7890.jpg\" alt=\"Zen atmosphere in the restaurant.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Zen atmosphere in the restaurant.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5086\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_7891.jpg\" alt=\"Our bikes parked across at the gas station.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Our bikes parked across at the gas station.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5087\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_7892.jpg\" alt=\"Cambodian locals strolling on the highway.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Cambodian locals strolling on the highway.</div>  Some 15 kilometers in front of Phnom Penh, there were finally some lights on the road! Also, the road boosted in overall quality too! Can\'t say about the traffic through... Even though the people obey the traffic rules here more than in Vietnam, the traffic is very chaotic once the tuk-tuks and cars start popping in. Anyways, we settled down in Okay Guesthouse and decided to take a walk around Phnom Penh at night.  The guesthouse is just between Wat Bokun Park and the riverside. We started our walk on the riverside, which is a pavement along the Mekon River coast. It looks well-designed, is relatively clean, and it attracts a lot of people wishing to relax by the Mekong. It also attracts a lot of street food stalls, one of them was selling fried bugs and frogs! We tried a few of them, but for me, it is a one time try! What I like about Phnom Penh is the vibe you can feel in the air. It has that laid back, relaxing aura flowing right through it that I just couldn\'t notice in Saigon. Maybe, that\'s because of the time constraint, who knows? But, the riverside also surprised me by how clean it is.  We walked to the center to Happy Pizza Place. Happy Pizza is popular around Cambodia for cannabis. They make pizza and put cannabis on it, giving you a mellow high at best. We ordered 2 small ones that cost about 6$ and enjoyed every bite of them. Just type in \'Happy Pizza\' in Google Maps once you\'re in Phnom Penh and you will find some places where you can order this kind of pizza. You can also score Cambodian Bush there, the price is as low as 1$/g. (the quality translates to that amount too!)  After getting slightly hammered by pizzas, we went back to our guesthouse through the relaxing Wat Bokun park and went to sleep. Tomorrow, we will explore more of what Phnom Penh has to offer for us!  <em>To get up to date, <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/day-5\"><strong>check out the previous chapter!</strong></a></em> <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Liked the post?

All kinds of noises that make it harder to sleep well. In the end, we woke up at 2 PM.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5094\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0853.jpg\" alt=\"Construction work taking place just beside our guesthouse.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Construction work taking place just beside our guesthouse.</div>  We decided to ride to the Central Market, the biggest market in Phnom Penh. It is located inside and on the outskirts of an X-shaped building that looks simply majestic! It\'s like a little city inside. You can find fresh food, clothes, jewelry, accessories and more things of your liking. I presume that you could spend an entire day at the Central Market and still not see everything on offer.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5096\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0866.jpg\" alt=\"The exterior of the Central Market.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The exterior of the Central Market.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5097\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0871.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the Central Market.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Inside the Central Market.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5098\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0873.jpg\" alt=\"Central Market is very busy and feels like a small city!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Central Market is very busy and feels like a small city!</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5099\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0880.jpg\" alt=\"A wonderful sculpture stand.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A wonderful sculpture stand.</div>  As we were very hungry, we were mainly looking for food. We found a little stall that was making some killer baguette sandwiches with papaya salad and skewer beef meat. You can also make the sandwiches yourself. Delicious! After devouring the Num Pang sandwiches, we set off on foot to find someplace to drink coffee.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5100\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0886.jpg\" alt=\"Delicious seafood is everywhere!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Delicious seafood is everywhere!</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5101\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0892.jpg\" alt=\"But, I prefer grilled beef and pork skewers inside a sandwich!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> But, I prefer grilled beef and pork skewers inside a sandwich!</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5102\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0895.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful ladies making the Num Pang sandwiches.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Beautiful ladies making the Num Pang sandwiches.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5103\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0896.jpg\" alt=\"More meat for all you meat lovers!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> More meat for all you meat lovers!</div>  Oh, I almost forgot! On the way to the Central Market, Antonio and Darian got pulled over by the police for speeding on the red light. In Vietnam, this wouldn\'t be a problem. Apparently, in Phnom Penh, traffic laws are reinforced if not for a sweet little bribe. The police officer asked the guys 10$ each and let them go.  Cruising around Phnom Penh on foot is highly enjoyable. Of course, you need to watch out for numerous tuk-tuks breezing through the streets, but the vibe is extremely relaxing. Feels a lot like Vietnam, but noticeably more undeveloped.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5104\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0916.jpg\" alt=\"A very busy intersection and a crumbling building.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A very busy intersection and a crumbling building.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5105\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0939.jpg\" alt=\"Motorbike riders waiting for that green light!

There are walls of garbage in some streets, and the waste disposal infrastructure is flawed at best. In the end, this garbage gets dumped near the Mekong or gets burned at designated places. Not the best way to go.  After a long walk, we finally managed to find a coffee place, where we sat down and learned a few Khmer phrases.  Here are some of them: <ul>   <li><strong>soos-a-day</strong> - hello</li>   <li><strong>lee-hi</strong> - goodbye</li>   <li><strong>sai-koo</strong> - beef</li>   <li><strong>sek-muan</strong> - chicken</li>   <li><strong>bai</strong> - rice</li>   <li><strong>aw-kon</strong> - thank you</li> </ul> Riding back to the guesthouse, it was already rush hour. And I must say, the traffic is crazy during this hour. Lots of cars and tuk-tuks make for some skill development in maneuvering through the labyrinths they make. The traffic doesn\'t flow like in Saigon because of that. We relaxed at the guesthouse a bit, then walked to the Happy Pizza place, this time, full small pizza for everyone! Fun times!  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5108\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0959.jpg\" alt=\"A Cambodian young man smiling for the camera!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A Cambodian young man smiling for the camera!</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5109\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0990.jpg\" alt=\"Sunset in Phnom Penh signalizes the rush hour.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Sunset in Phnom Penh signalizes the rush hour.</div>  Tomorrow, we will check out the National Museum and Wat Phnom.  <em>To get up to date, <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/day-6\"><strong>check out the previous chapter!</strong></a></em> <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Liked the post?

Our plan for today was to check out the National Museum which is very close to our guesthouse, and Wat Phnom, the place where Phnom Penh came to be, the only hill in the city.  After snatching some awesome Pad Thai at the street food stall, we continued on to the national museum. Once you come inside, you will see a huge red building with ancient markings and statues.

I would say, take the audio guide too, because I didn\'t take it, and most of the things were without captions. The museum is full of ancient statues and carvings. Inside the museum, there is also the largest hand weaved scarf in the world! Anyway, I wouldn\'t say that this museum is worth 10$ if you go in without the audio guide.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5129\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0078.jpg\" alt=\"An elephant guards the entrance to the National Museum.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> An elephant guards the entrance to the National Museum.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5118\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0080.jpg\" alt=\"The architecture and the features of the National Museum are simply awesome!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The architecture and the features of the National Museum are simply awesome!</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5119\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0101.jpg\" alt=\"The intricately designed roof of National Museum.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The intricately designed roof of National Museum.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5130\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0103.jpg\" alt=\"Who is a better Buddha?\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Who is a better Buddha?</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5131\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0107.jpg\" alt=\"The garden area of the National Museum radiates with a zen vibe.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The garden area of the National Museum radiates with a zen vibe.</div>  After exploring the National Museum, we rode out to the Wat Phnom.

This place is really chill, a huge park in the middle of the city, and a nice little relaxing hike.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5120\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0122.jpg\" alt=\"The entrance to Wat Phnom.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The entrance to Wat Phnom.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5132\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0127.jpg\" alt=\"The sumptuous golden statue in the middle of the park.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The sumptuous golden statue in the middle of the park.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5121\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0131.jpg\" alt=\"An intricately designed Khmer carving.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> An intricately designed Khmer carving.</div>  On top of the hill, there is a pagoda and a huge white stupa.

In the end, I lost the crew and cruised around the neighborhood. I found a nice street food place with some killer Num Pang! (baguette sandwiches).  Eventually, we met up at the same place and had an awesome dinner. After the regular dinner, we went to the Happy Pizza place to eat \'happy\' dinner and drink some fresh beer.  Tomorrow, we will check out the S-21 and the infamous Killing Fields, to circle out our visit to Phnom Penh.  <em>To get up to date, <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/day-7\"><strong>check out the previous chapter!</strong></a></em> <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Liked the post?

This place was an elementary school before the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge\"><strong>Khmer Rouge</strong></a> regime. During the second half of the 1970s, Cambodia was ruled by a totalitarian regime that abolished money, possessions, education; and removed the people from the cities to working fields, where they were forced to work 18 hours, without pauses and with 180g of sticky rice to eat in two days.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5154\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0255.jpg\" alt=\"The 10 commandments of the S-21.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The 10 commandments of the S-21.</div>  This regime was responsible for the vanishment of 25% of the Cambodian population (7 million was the total population at that time).

Most of the people here died of starvation, as they were tied up, and were allowed to eat their feces, nothing more.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5139\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0289.jpg\" alt=\"Most of the beds in Tuol Sleng have a lock, symbolizing the hardships of the prisoners there.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Most of the beds in Tuol Sleng have a lock, symbolizing the hardships of the prisoners there.</div>  In one room, there are hundreds of photos of the victims of this S-21 jail. It was depressing to see the hopeless looks on the faces of people on the photos, especially children.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5156\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0304-e1568200262398.jpg\" alt=\"Just 2 prisoners the S-21 has took out of estimated 20,000 prisoners.\" width=\"684\" height=\"1024\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Just 2 prisoners the S-21 has took out of estimated 20,000 prisoners.</div>  There are a few survivor stories on display that show that the Vietnamese came marching to Phnom Penh to \'liberate\' Cambodia from the cruel Khmer Rouge regime.

It is an extremely depressing, yet educative place, and I think that it is important to know what happened to the people here in recent history to understand why their country felt behind so much.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5140\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0321.jpg\" alt=\"Wired fence was used to contain the captives from attempting to escape, mostly by jumping to their suicide.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Wired fence was used to contain the captives from attempting to escape, mostly by jumping to their suicide.</div>  <img class=\"wp-image-5141 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0331.jpg\" alt=\"A message wall located in the Tuol Sleng complex is a place where visitors can express their compassion to the victims of the horrors that ocurred here.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A message wall located in the Tuol Sleng complex is a place where visitors can express their compassion to the victims of the horrors that ocurred here.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5155\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0349.jpg\" alt=\"There is also the White Lotus room incorporated in the complex, providing a space to relax and reflect on what you have just seen inside.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> There is also the White Lotus room incorporated in the complex, providing a space to relax and reflect on what you have just seen inside.</div>  We didn\'t have time to visit the Killing Fields, as they are outside the city. But, we had arranged a free Mekong River Cruise with our guesthouse, so that was our next stop. It starts at 5:30 PM and lasts 2 hours. We were in a huge rush but eventually reached our ship.  The cruise was simply amazing. Observing the sunset and the skyline of the city while slowly sailing through the huge Mekong River. There was also some local Cambodian music, which sounded nice; and of course, food and drinks!  <img class=\"wp-image-5142 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0380.jpg\" alt=\"Roneak Ek, producing Khmer tra(n)ditional music, was a soothing accompaniment to the Mekong River cruise.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Roneak Ek, producing Khmer tra(n)ditional music, was a soothing accompaniment to the Mekong River cruise.</div>  <img class=\"wp-image-5143 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0383.jpg\" alt=\"Mekong River slices Phnom Penh on two islands.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Mekong River slices Phnom Penh on two islands.</div>  We also sailed through some really dirty riverside villages. I saw that they throw the trash in the river or burn it on the shores. That just showcases the problem of waste management in Cambodia and the lack of education regarding it.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5144\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0430.jpg\" alt=\"One of the numerous shore villages in Cambodia.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> One of the numerous shore villages in Cambodia.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5152\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0432.jpg\" alt=\"Mekong River village up close.

After 2 hours of cruising, we were immensely hungry and eager to find some street food.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5146\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0481.jpg\" alt=\"Phnom Penh provides a colorful ambience at night.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Phnom Penh provides a colorful ambience at night.</div>  Afterward, we returned to our guesthouse.

Today, it is time to go to sleep earlier, as the ride to Siem Reap begins tomorrow!  <em>To get up to date, <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/day-8\"><strong>check out the previous chapter!</strong></a></em> <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Liked the post?

(12741, 2, '2019-09-15 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'Today is our last day in Phnom Penh. We are starting our ride to Siem Reap. The decision was made to slice up the road to Siem Reap in half, staying in Kampong Thom for a night or two. We checked out of Okay Guesthouse and were ready to tie up some loose ends.  Before setting off for Kampong Thom, we visited Happy Pizza. There, they serve some killer fruit shakes for just 1$. After devouring the banana shake and doing the resupply, we finally set off from Phnom Penh!  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5163\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0484.jpg\" alt=\"Devouring a banana fruit shake to fill up for the road ahead!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Devouring a banana fruit shake to fill up for the road ahead!</div>  Well, getting out of Phnom Penh is such a breeze compared to Saigon! On the outskirts of the city, we found a street stall that was serving various skewers combined with papaya salad. It was a nice meal, even though it had some fish sauce inside. When you\'re hungry, your expectations drop, and that is okay.  A few kilometers down the road, we found a nice coffee place to energize and relax before the chaotic main road kicks in.  The road to Kampong Thom is 170 km long and goes exclusively on National Road 6. This slice of the road amazes with its scenery of rice paddies, and the lowlands stretching into infinity, with palm trees randomly popping up on the canvas.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5168\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0541.jpg\" alt=\"Wonderful sunset just elevates this seemingly infinite stretch of rice paddies scenery.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Wonderful sunset just elevates this seemingly infinite stretch of rice paddies scenery.</div>  Of course, as this road connects Siem Reap and Phnom Penh, it is quite busy. Lots of fast driving trucks, cars, and buses that sometimes push you off the side of the road when they pile up one after another.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5169\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0516.jpg\" alt=\"The traffic on this main road can elevate to crazy levels!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The traffic on this main road can elevate to crazy levels!</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5170\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0531.jpg\" alt=\"Yes, even bicycles are often part of the traffic on this main road!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Yes, even bicycles are often part of the traffic on this main road!</div>  Riding for more than 2 hours on a scooter with a travel bag on the bag will require you to stretch here in a while. On one such stretch pause, we discovered banana chips! They are quite delicious! We also filled our gas tanks at the roadside multi-purpose stall, took some photos with the family owning that stall, and continued our ride.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5166\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0536.jpg\" alt=\"A lovely Cambodian family posing for the photo!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A lovely Cambodian family posing for the photo!</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5167\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0539.jpg\" alt=\"Darian joins the photo session with the Cambodian family!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Darian joins the photo session with the Cambodian family!</div>  After a 4 hour ride, we finally arrived in Kampong Thom! We unpacked our stuff in a spacy room that is full of cockroaches.  The town square is just out of the side street our guesthouse is, where it is still busy after 9 PM. There are a lot of local food stands to offer fruit shakes and rice meals. We found a local restaurant on the backside of the square, that served some great rice and beef combo. After dinner, we ordered some beers and went to the square statues to relax a bit.  On the way to our guesthouse, we noticed a huge KTV building at the beginning of our street. KTV is essentially a karaoke bar, but once you go inside, you realize that it walks the line between karaoke bar, hostess bar, and a brothel. We asked the manager about the price of the room, which is 10$ for 1 hour of karaoke. After getting the information, we returned to our guesthouse.  The night was reserved for reflection time on the balcony, where we could also observe the local life. The area around KTV is constantly busy, with locals driving off ladies all the time. There is also a wild dog pack that howls in the early morning and are quite wonky when it comes to crossing the road. One such dog almost got ran over by locals on a motorbike. Anyway, after a night of observation, it is time to rest for a while. Tomorrow, we will explore Phnom Samui, a hill some 20 kilometers away from Kampong Thom.  <em>To get up to date, <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/day-9\"><strong>check out the previous chapter!</strong></a></em> <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Liked the post?

Before starting with pure productivity, I relaxed on the balcony, observing the flow of life in the neighborhood. Locals tend to their gardens and go to the market on their motorbikes. In the distance, a Buddhist chant can be heard via a megaphone. Probably prayer time for local monks.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5191\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0562.jpg\" alt=\"The view of the neighborhood.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The view of the neighborhood.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5175\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0558.jpg\" alt=\"A bicycle is also one of the most popular means of transport in Cambodia.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A bicycle is also one of the most popular means of transport in Cambodia.</div> <h2>Preparing for the Hike</h2> Anyways, after doing my work, I ventured to the gas station to fill up the juice on my bike for the upcoming day trip. While waiting for Antonio and Lovel to finish their bike check at the mechanic shop, I got off to explore the area across the bridge. There is a nice little riviera here that is quite relaxing.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5190\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0582.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Mystic dragon statue by the Stung Sen River.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5176\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0580.jpg\" alt=\"Stung Sen River flows through Kampong Thom.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Stung Sen River flows through Kampong Thom.</div>  After the guys were done with their bike checks, we cruised around the local town market to find something to eat. The market is full of fresh fruit, vegetables, and the fresh scent of seafood, of course! We found a place to eat but didn\'t know what to expect. At most street food stalls, you can see what is being cooked, so you know what to expect. I picked a soup with beef skin that had a really bad taste that almost got me in a nausea state. I managed to eat almost all of it in the end, but wouldn\'t say that I would try this meal again. Fish sauce in a soup with beef skin is not such a great combination.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5192\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0588.jpg\" alt=\"The busy main street.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The busy main street.</div>  We also found a comfortable coffee place that is a movie theater at the same time. Well, not your classic movie theater as there are three TV screens, one showing WWE wrestling, one showing a Korean kung-fu movie with Cambodian dub, and one that is showing Cambodian news.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5189\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0790.jpg\" alt=\"The comfy coffee place feels like a cinema.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The comfy coffee place feels like a cinema.</div>  After sipping our coffee, we rode back to prepare the gear for our day trip to Phnom Santuk. <h2><strong>Ready for the Hike</strong></h2> The ride to Phnom Santuk is a relaxing one, as there was not a lot of traffic en route to the hill. On the way, we lost Antonio and Darian. After waiting for 10 minutes, I and Lovel decided that we continue without them, as they knew where the location is and would go up the hill with their motorbikes, rather than hiking on foot.  Sliding off the main road into the dust trail through the rural part of Cambodia is amazing. The bypassing people look at you with huge smiles and spread the positivity around. After getting closer to the hill, we were stopped by a local man who was selling tickets.  The <strong>entrance fee to Phnom Santuk is 2$</strong>, and the hike is totally worth it. To the left is the vehicle route to the hilltop, while on the right is the route to the village where the hiking route to the hilltop begins. We proceeded that way and were welcomed by a local kid who gave us the parking spot for 50 cents each. The raindrops could be felt a bit, but nothing too detracting from the hike.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5193\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0599.jpg\" alt=\"The entrance to Phnom Santuk hike.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The entrance to Phnom Santuk hike.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5178\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0596.jpg\" alt=\"Numerous mystic statues will follow you on the way to the top of the hill.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Numerous mystic statues will follow you on the way to the top of the hill.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5177\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0597.jpg\" alt=\"There is something really calming about this hike.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> There is something really calming about this hike.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5194\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0624.jpg\" alt=\"The hike over the 800 stairs can be quite tiring if you tread too fast, combined with the humid air!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The hike over the 800 stairs can be quite tiring if you tread too fast, combined with the humid air!</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5195\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0627.jpg\" alt=\"You get greeted by amazing views of the lowlands below on the way to the top.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> You get greeted by amazing views of the lowlands below on the way to the top.</div>  There are <strong>800 steps</strong> to the top of the hill. The steps are very steep, and it is a bit tiring to get to the top. On the way to the top, there are some amazing viewpoints over the lowlands below, and you can even see the glow of Tonle Sap in the distance! Macaque monkeys start showing up more frequently as you are reaching the top. The sounds of the tree leaves indicate that they are jumping around.  The macaque monkeys are usually not harmful to humans if not provoked. They can be pretty territorial, asking for a snack before letting you pass. The macaques live in a matriarchy, with the mother being bloating huge and caring for its young ones. Make sure that you don\'t provoke the mother alpha by provoking her children, as the monkeys will then turn their attention to you.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5197\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0635.jpg\" alt=\"Once you get closer to the top, more monkeys start to appear!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Once you get closer to the top, more monkeys start to appear!</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5199\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0649.jpg\" alt=\"Young macaques with their curious looks.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Young macaques with their curious looks.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5198\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0655.jpg\" alt=\"A small macaque awaiting guests at the entrance.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A small macaque awaiting guests at the entrance.</div>  Anyways, the hilltop is really zen. <strong>Lots of monkeys</strong> running around the numerous shrines and golden stupas, while feeling the scent of the burning sticks in the air.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5179\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0668.jpg\" alt=\"A shrine that radiates with tranquil energy.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A shrine that radiates with tranquil energy.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5200\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0670.jpg\" alt=\"Yellow candle wax symbolizes the enlightenment of the Buddha.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Yellow candle wax symbolizes the enlightenment of the Buddha.</div>  We sat down for a bit to relax from the hike and observed the young Buddhist monk below us. He got his sugar cane juice stolen by a sneaky monkey, so he was throwing rocks on him. It can be seen that he means them no harm, as he was throwing rocks at the safe distance from the monkeys.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5180\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0689.jpg\" alt=\"Sneaky macaque ready to get his hands on some juice!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Sneaky macaque ready to get his hands on some juice!</div>  We found Antonio and Darian relaxing on the rock that is an awesome viewpoint on the Cambodian lowlands.

As I and Lovel were on foot, we decided that we should start our descent before we get cast up in darkness. The monkeys started their descent too, and these are very territorial! They blocked the stairs, so we began our descent down the road that is made for vehicles. The darkness eventually swallowed us, but the numerous fireflies lighted the way for us. Also, there are a lot of small bats that just love flying into my hair! Eventually, we found the village in which we parked our bikes and set off to Kampong Thom!  The road back to the main road is shrouded in pitch-darkness and unpaved. But, it is absolutely amazing to hit the off-road and see that this bike is reliable enough for this. On the main road, we stopped at the roadside restaurant for some rice, vegetables and chicken combination and a few beers that lifted our spirits up.  As our muscles were really tired and sore after the hike, when we returned to Kampong Thom, we decided that we should find a massage place. First, we looked around our neighborhood but found out that most of them are closed at 10 PM.  Eventually, we found a massage place on the northern side of the river that cost 5$/1 hour Khmer massage. Khmer massage is similar to Thai massage, a bit rough and painful in some parts, but gets the job done. Also, no oil! The massage begins with leg and foot massage, then continues to the arm and hand massage before transferring to the back. The back was the most painful one. For the end, head massage and neck massage really closed off the deal nicely. Beautiful Khmer girl did the job well and after the massage session, I felt really clear in my mind and body. It was also a fun experience, as this lady was teaching me some Khmer words during the massage.  After the massage, we relaxed a bit on the balcony before going to rest. Tomorrow, we will explore the jungle temples around Kampong Thom!  <em>To get up to date, <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/day-10\"><strong>check out the previous chapter!</strong></a></em> <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Liked the post?

The scent of Durian can be strongly felt around the stall, so it was reasonable to try out a fruit shake with Durian, combined with bananas. It is a delicious combination! Also, really cheap noodle soup with chicken! After the meal, we prepared for temple exploration with some local coffee at the \'cinema\' place. Finally, we are ready to hit the road to the jungle temples!  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5212\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0794.jpg\" alt=\"Ready to hit the road to the jungle!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Ready to hit the road to the jungle!</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5213\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0798.jpg\" alt=\"A really creative roundabout showing an elephant fighting two tigers.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A really creative roundabout showing an elephant fighting two tigers.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5214\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0797.jpg\" alt=\"This can be quite a busy town sometimes.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> This can be quite a busy town sometimes.</div>  The jungle temples are 20 km northeast of Kampong Thom. The first part of the road to there is quite decent until you hit the villages. The road there is driveable but full of holes. Amazing scenery though! Also, riding through the rural area is special. People will look at you with beautiful smiles and wish you a good day most of the time when you pass around them.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5215\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0809.jpg\" alt=\"A man doing the field work with a motocultivator.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A man doing the fieldwork with a motor cultivator.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5218\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0865.jpg\" alt=\"The beautiful green fields will dominate thee scenery on the way to the jungle.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The beautiful green fields will dominate the scenery on the way to the jungle.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5217\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0918.jpg\" alt=\"Taking the cattle out for a walk.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Taking the cattle out for a walk.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5216\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0876.jpg\" alt=\"Our Yamaha \'machines\' !\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Our Yamaha \'machines\'!</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5219\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0956.jpg\" alt=\"Entering the village before the jungle.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Entering the village before the jungle.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5220\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0965.jpg\" alt=\"A beautiful road section awaits on the final stretch before the jungle.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A beautiful road section awaits on the final stretch before the jungle.</div>  After a while, we got to the Tamon Temple and walked around the beautiful jungle a bit. These temples are older than the temples in the Angkor Wat complex, but not as majestic.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5221\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0968.jpg\" alt=\"Arrived to the first temple, Tamon Temple!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Arrived to the first temple, Tamon Temple!</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5222\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0975.jpg\" alt=\"Tamon Temple features beautiful carvings.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Tamon Temple features beautiful carvings.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5223\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0980.jpg\" alt=\"Dense jungle beside Tamon Temple.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Dense jungle beside Tamon Temple.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5224\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0017-1.jpg\" alt=\"Rice paddies just outside the jungle.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Rice paddies just outside the jungle.</div>  The other temples are located deeper in the jungle. We passed through a ticket checkpoint, but there was nobody around, so we just continued to enter the jungle. This was our first jungle ride in Cambodia and it is amazing! Once we were hitting the muddy roads, we knew we were on the right track! Hindu temples are scattered all around this jungle, showing up with their mystical appearance in the dense jungle. We also found an abandoned treehouse village near the river.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5225\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0034.jpg\" alt=\"You will be tempted to stop here in a while and absorb all the energy around you!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> You will be tempted to stop here in a while and absorb all the energy around you!</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5226\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0040.jpg\" alt=\"A wonderful early sunset.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A wonderful early sunset.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5227\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0044.jpg\" alt=\"Entering deeper into the jungle.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Entering deeper into the jungle.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5228\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0046.jpg\" alt=\"A deep jungle trail that is quite well-maintained.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A deep jungle trail that is quite well-maintained.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5230\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0049.jpg\" alt=\"An unmarked Hindu temple slowly getting reclaimed by nature.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> An unmarked Hindu temple slowly getting reclaimed by nature.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5231\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0058.jpg\" alt=\"The entrance to the Hindu temple ruin.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> The entrance to the Hindu temple ruin.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5229\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0053.jpg\" alt=\"A river of ants constantly in the flow.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A river of ants constantly in the flow.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5232\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0100.jpg\" alt=\"An abandoned riverside village.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> An abandoned riverside village.</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5233\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0110.jpg\" alt=\"They abandoned the hammocks too!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> They abandoned the hammocks too!</div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5234\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0129.jpg\" alt=\"Another unmarked temple with an interesting design.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Another unmarked temple with an interesting design.</div>  After taking our time diving into the jungle and the mystic remains of a long lost civilization, the dark was near. We quickly rode away from the jungle, backtracking through villages in pure darkness. At one point we saw a peculiar sight. A drunk father is trying to hold onto his bike while his young son was following him with a cow beside them. They probably had a long way to go.  On the way back to Kampong Thom, we stopped at a random roadside restaurant where we ate some epic baguette sandwiches with beef skewers, all served with papaya salad and hot chili. One slightly drunk man made us at home with his toasts and lots of beer. We also learned him our toast phrase: \'Živjeli!\'. It was a really lovely random little moment. After devouring the sandwiches, we continued to Kampong Thom.  After getting back to our guest house, I felt the tiredness from the jungle combined with a mellow beer influence.  After that, we had a long, long night that was fueled by many beers. I can only say that this was definitely one of the most fun and weirdest nights in Cambodia so far!  <em>To get up to date, <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/day-11\"><strong>check out the previous chapter!</strong></a></em> <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Liked the post?

(12744, 3, '2019-10-15 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'Da Nang, a pearl of Central Vietnam, is an attractive vacation destination as the city features endless sandy beaches, stunning mountains, delicious traditional food, vibrant local community, and affordable prices. The city has undergone a rapid development boom that started roughly 10 years ago and, by stories from locals, Da Nang is a completely different city now. If you\'re planning to visit Da Nang anytime soon, but you\'re short on time, then our 3 days in Da Nang itinerary is for you.  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> <strong>A few notes before starting:</strong> Please keep in mind this itinerary is solely based on our subjective experience of Da Nang. We give our best to provide you with a balanced itinerary, so everyone can enjoy and explore the beauty this city has to offer. Last but not least, we\'re going to start straight with the itinerary for each day following with details such as transportation, food, prices, and accommodation. </div> <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>3 Days in Da Nang Itinerary - Balance Between Local and Tourist Experience</strong></h2> Da Nang, as the pearl of central Vietnam, is regarded as the most livable city in Vietnam. Most people spend only a day or two at most in Da Nang while missing out on the beautiful things the city has to offer. I\'ve been traveling around Da Nang and Quang Nam province multiple times before deciding to move here to live. During that time, I\'ve put a lot of energy and time into exploring every corner of the city and its surrounding area to get a better understanding of people and culture.  It\'s a very tough task to create a one-fits-all itinerary, so I tried to create a balanced 3 days in Da Nang itinerary here. If you\'re looking for a tailored Da Nang itinerary, we can help you create one that suits your preferences and budget.  <div data-gyg-href=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/default/activites.frame\" data-gyg-locale-code=\"en-US\" data-gyg-widget=\"activities\" data-gyg-number-of-items=\"3\" data-gyg-currency=\"EUR\" data-gyg-partner-id=\"781AB6P\" data-gyg-q=\"Da Nang\"></div> <script async defer src=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js\"></script> <h3><strong>Day 1 - Jungle Exploration &amp; Food Heaven</strong></h3> <img class=\"wp-image-5286 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da4586e815c3.jpg\" alt=\"Sunrise on the My Khe beach\" width=\"1025\" height=\"590\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Sunrise on Son Tra Peninsula, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/138100930@N04/35860629610/in/photolist-6PhxAF-qfwstJ-o6pSLP-6Q9Cip-qfvzds-o2vgjD-bNzfm2-6NQ51E-qDc4vo-6NQ6uW-6NQ9Zs-bzECrC-bzEBoJ-bzEzCf-bNzeY8-bzEAZw-bNzeFn-bNzcWg-bNzgpT-bzEv43-bNze14-mNkAPv-WCT6Pq-gNbUEj-gNcV5c\">Le Anh Tuan</a></div>  I can\'t recommend more waking up early and heading to My Khe beach to enjoy the breathtaking sunrise. If you\'re an active type then you\'ll definitely fell in love with the vibe of My Khe beach in the morning. People, young and old, go out for a morning physical activity and socializing. Running, or simply walking along the beach while observing stunning sunrise can\'t be a better way to start your first day in Da Nang. Jump to the ocean for refreshment, take a shower and start the exploration.  Since you\'ve already started off your day with physical activity, hiking and exploring beautiful nature is a thing I\'d recommend. Hiring a scooter for a three-day stay is the right thing to do if you have a <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-driving-license\"><strong>proper driving license</strong></a> and driving experience. Head over to Son Tra Peninsula and enjoy stunning beauty overlooking the bustle and hustle of the city. <p id=\"fIGqgIT\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5301 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da462d733a3e.jpg\" alt=\"Linh Ung Pagoda\" width=\"1003\" height=\"725\" /></p> We have a comprehensive post about <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/son-tra-peninsula\"><strong>things to do in Son Tra Peninsula</strong></a>, so it\'s a great start to plan your trip there. As for highlights, I would mention Linh Ung pagoda, driving to the old Banyan tree and slowly progressing to Ban Co Peak. For a proper exploration of Son Tra, you can expect to <strong>spend at least 4 - 6 hours in the jungle</strong>. Also, the sunset is amazing when observed from Ban Co peak or in front of Linh Ung pagoda.  Once you\'re done driving around Son Tra, you\'ll probably feel drained, so what could be better than a good treat with Vietnamese food? A seafood lover here? Just follow the main road down the Son Tra and you\'ll be soon driving on Hoang Sa beach road. On the right side, you\'ll see many seafood restaurants filled with locals. Go there and order some of the most delicious, freshest and arguably the best seafood in Da Nang. If the seafood isn\'t your thing, then head to Châu Thị Vĩnh Tế street for diverse Vietnamese cuisine. Literally, you can find almost all kinds of Vietnamese traditional food in tiny local restaurants or street food stalls. Happen to prefer western food after an exhaustive day? Head over to the An Thượng Night Market where you can enjoy western delicacies such as pizza, hamburgers, tacos, sausages and similar. <p id=\"fPWCEFT\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5302 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da463e927d64.jpg\" alt=\"Han River Da Nang, Vietnam \" width=\"1178\" height=\"659\" /></p> Once you feel like you\'ve eaten enough, the good thing would be to relax with a glass or two of craft beer. Head over to <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/7bridgesbrewingco/\">7 Bridges Brewing Company</a></strong> and enjoy the taste of their diverse craft beer selection. From there, I recommend two options - heading over to Han River pubs and enjoy commercial music, not so lively nightlife and beautiful views or heading over the more relaxed area for some live music, good conversations, and cheap beers. The majority of pubs are located on a Bach Dang street just after you pass Dragon Bridge and it\'s might be a suitable place for a pub crawl.  For relaxed bars and atmosphere, I recommend visiting <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/heavenbar47/\"><strong>Heaven bar</strong></a> or <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/crazycatcoffeepub/\"><strong>Crazy Cat</strong></a> where you can feel a community and expats sharing ideas while listening to creative music and enjoying sips of local beer.  Whatever option you choose, it\'s a great way to finish off your first day in Da Nang, get some sleep and get ready for the day to come.  <strong>Day 1 Summary:</strong> <ul>   <li>watch sunrise at My Khe beach</li>   <li>drive around Son Tra Peninsula (Linh Ung Pagoda, Banyan Tree, Ban Co Peak)</li>   <li>eat a fresh seafood at beach restaurants near Son Tra Peninsula</li>   <li>enjoy craft beer with stunning views at 7 Bridges Brewing Company</li>   <li>do a pub crawl or relax in expat area</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Day 2 - Market Hustle &amp; Marble Mountain</strong></h3> <p id=\"aWXCJzd\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5300 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da4621414cc9.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnamese food market\" width=\"1074\" height=\"709\" /></p> Feeling a bit hungover or tired from yesterday? Head over to Bac My An market for a heavy treat. It features a diverse selection of traditional food including all types of noodle dishes, affordable fruit shakes or juices and the iconic avocado icecream! If you\'re looking for souvenirs or clothes, there is also a clothes market next to the food stalls where you can find interesting deals.  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> <strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> Always negotiate prices when buying goods on any Vietnamese market. What strategy I\'ve found effective? For the majority of goods, cut the asking price by 70% and start negotiating from there. People will usually settle at 50 - 60% of a starting price. It\'s not disrespecting to bargain and local sellers love to engage in the good negotiation process. Also, knowing a phrase or two on Vietnamese can land you a better deal.</div>  After a good treat, it\'s time for a <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide\"><strong>traditional Vietnamese coffee</strong></a> at a traditionally looking cafe called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/trinhcaphedn/\"><strong>Trinh Cafe</strong></a>. I personally like that place since it\'s looking like cafes in Vietnam during the 70s, has a thuốc lào (Vietnamese tobacco bong), and a great selection of drinks. Another similar place that comes to my mind is <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NAMhouseCoffee/\"><strong>Nam House</strong></a> that\'s located on the other side of the city and it\'s very popular among the local hipster scene. If you\'re looking for a nice talk with young locals, then heading over to Nam House might be a great option.  <img class=\"wp-image-5297 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da4602dd8761.jpg\" alt=\"Marble Mountain Da Nang, Vietnam\" width=\"971\" height=\"601\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> By <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/guerretto/14968807899/in/photolist-oNK45P-fV25Rq-o4ZAWj-226yaRc-Jw5dVp-23q9r8N-dr4k7e-dsQcWK-dsQufC-pvkzPH-oNp19D-p5RTsL-dsQ6bt-oNpjyW-DNYcEB-oNoSqH-p5CHA6-oNp6nz-DNYiuc-rgtHTh-p3RZb5-p3S1iL-23sStUT-p5RT9E-oNoW8c-oFxSH3-p3RVpC-p5RKwW-oNoXii-oNp8jm-22oeD29-oNpBzY-p3S3wd-p3RRzd-pRxdmZ-oNp7uf-p5RKT7-po3UqD-9x6dmn-S86Z6W-oJeKPF-p5CEjB-oEtk8G-oJeHxM-MxwqKc-FzwPQe-pRBt3G-MpgHm7-oNpNYP-oNoZBr\">Guerretto</a> - Marble Mountain, Da Nang, Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0)</div>  Once you\'re done with a coffee and you feel at your peak again, I recommend driving to Marble Mountain. It\'s a limestone mountain that features a few Buddhist temples, caves, viewpoints and lots of stairs. It\'s such a great workout that rewards you with stunning views over the city and the beach. The entrance fee is <strong>40,000 VND and expect to stay there for about 2 hours</strong>. <p id=\"BGLIgGy\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5298 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da461315ddeb.jpg\" alt=\"At the top of Hai Van Pass\" width=\"1002\" height=\"741\" /></p> After you\'re done with the exploration of Marble Mountain, you\'ll definitely feel exhaustion and pain in every part of your body. The best way to avoid soreness is by jumping in the ocean on the My Khe beach and enjoy the vibe with sips of delicious coconut juice (around 30,000 VND). From there, I\'d recommend two ways - either drive to the top of Hai Van Pass for the extremely beautiful driving experience or simply get to a rooftop bar and enjoy cocktails with a beautiful sunset in sight. If you decide for later, then I can\'t recommend more <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/2mai0103/\"><strong>Alacarte Hotel</strong></a> and its rooftop on the 24th floor. They have a <strong>happy hour from 3 - 6 pm each day offering two beers for 80,000 VND total</strong>.  Once the sun sets behind the horizon, it\'s time to refill your energy with a nice bowl of Bún thịt nướng or Banh Xeo. Head over to Pham Cu Luong street and get into one of the local Banh Xeo restaurants. Don\'t forget to order plenty of Nem Lui and a few cans of local Larue beer. <p id=\"xNOgxKN\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5299 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da461a43ec5e.jpg\" alt=\"Dragon Bridge in Da Nang\" width=\"1072\" height=\"709\" /></p> If your second day in Da Nang falls on the weekend, then don\'t forget to watch a Dragon Bridge show that starts every Saturday and Sunday from 9 pm. A dragon from the bridge spits fire and water and it looks nice, but if you\'re like me and you don\'t like overcrowded places then you\'d probably not enjoy it. Head over to Cau Nguyen Van Troi bridge (out-of-traffic-bridge next to Tran Thi Ly bridge) and enjoy beautiful Dragon Bridge show from a distance with fewer people and local vibe.  It\'s probably around 10 pm now, and you\'ve been around for the whole day. Go back to your hotel, relax a bit and take a sleep since you\'ll need that energy for the last day in stunning Da Nang.  <strong>Day 2 Summary:</strong> <ul>   <li>enjoy traditional Vietnamese food and My An Market + get some souvenirs and clothes</li>   <li>drink traditional coffee and Nam House or Trinh Cafe</li>   <li>explore Marble Mountain</li>   <li>get some drinks at a rooftop bar and enjoy the sunset</li>   <li>experience a Dragon Bridge show on the weekend</li> </ul> <h3><strong>Day 3 - Day Trips From Da Nang</strong></h3> <p id=\"PUNotCp\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5292 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da45dd726ae6.jpg\" alt=\"My Son Ruins in Quang Nam\" width=\"1075\" height=\"711\" /></p> For the third day in Da Nang, I would recommend taking a day trip out of the city and visit beautiful and historic places. One historic place is called My Son and it\'s located in a neighboring Quang Nam province around 50 km out of the city center. The ruins are a heritage of the Champa empire where you can wander around a cluster of abandoned, and not so preserved Hindu temples. The entrance fee is <strong>150,000 VND and you can visit temples every day from 6:30 am - 5:30 pm</strong>. <p id=\"qxzYPrs\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5293 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da45e6a65090.jpg\" alt=\"Ba Na Hills\" width=\"1141\" height=\"709\" /></p> The second option would be visiting popular Ba Na Hills and iconic Golden Bridge that gives its visitors really beautiful views of the surrounding area and, on clear days, a whole Da Nang city. The ride to Ba Na Hills is simply amazing featuring stunning landscape and wide road. Expect to pay <strong>700,000 VND for the entrance fee</strong> that covers cable car, all attractions and much more. Personally, I don\'t like Ba Na Hills so much since it\'s an overcrowded place and the majority of photos you see on Instagram are heavily edited. <p id=\"OxAazjX\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5296 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da45f7c327ef.jpg\" alt=\"Hoi An Ancient Town\" width=\"1182\" height=\"776\" /></p> The last but not least would be visiting a charming ancient town of Hoi An that is located just about 35 km south from Da Nang. Getting to Hoi An is pretty straightforward - just follow the beach road and eventually you\'ll end up in a small and crowded town. Walk around the ancient town, enjoy delicious food on the food market, enjoy the countless rivers, take a boat tour, get a tailored suit (or Ao Dai) are just some of the ideas you can do in beautiful Hoi An. If you decide to visit Hoi An at night, I can\'t recommend more to book a night in a local homestay. The mornings around the ricefields are simply amazing since you\'ll be gifted with stunning sunrise and observation of locals\' lifestyle.  <strong>Day 3 Summary:</strong> <ul>   <li>visit Ba Na Hills or</li>   <li>visit My Son in Quang Nam or</li>   <li>explore beautiful Hoi An and book a night in a homestay</li> </ul> <h2><strong>Getting To &amp; Around Da Nang</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5291 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da45c95777ff.jpg\" alt=\"Traffic in Vietnam\" width=\"970\" height=\"643\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> By <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/wackelijmrooster/2768187252/in/photolist-5dBFCq-8D7wvi-4bVnXY-62X7zj-ecx2q9-bzEQvf-RCLTpR-9rthPC-SCZAfA-bzEviW-bzEv43-ShTzaQ-2cgmFCY-pDB83y-ecrpnx-gyormw-o8xFsd-djbAbB-sa2XMi-y6J6x-5SrfW-aqzViS-246fDZX-b6k7Mg-y6J93-y6HZB-b6jJPt-bM4wiZ-8wiKbw-y6HWP-gyq2qS-21LQqxQ-RCH6Tr-SSGFhT-SCYSD9-2aQhiHU-ShNXEj-9PPGY8-r2BPDU-ShTMFm-SFiitR-SP6zgo-ShQc5J-2cNmAxG-2ckTB8Q-bNzfm2-P7AHqn-Qoyf1y-fBTYa8-bNztRa\">Marcel Oosterwijk</a> - Hanoi Traffic, Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic (CC BY-SA 2.0)</div>  Since Da Nang is the 5th biggest city in Vietnam and annually hosts more than 8 million tourists, the tourism infrastructure is very developed. Getting to and around the city is convenient, efficient and affordable: <ul>   <li>domestic or international flight</li>   <li>bus</li>   <li>train (recommended if you\'re traveling from Hue)</li>   <li>motorbike (don\'t miss Hai Van pass)</li> </ul> The international airport is located literally in the city\'s center and only 5 km away from My Khe beach. Grab is a popular and affordable option to get out of the airport. Depending on your destination, you can expect to pay around 100,000 VND for a Grab drive + 10,000 VND for car airport fees.  If you\'re traveling from the north, you can consider getting a train from Hue to Da Nang via Hai Van Pass. It\'s arguably the most scenic train ride in a whole Vietnam since train passes around stunning Hai Van. Always book your train ticket in advance since this particular line is usually booked. You can expect around 3 hours of driving so we recommend booking a soft seat. The prices for a one-way train ticket is around 150,000 VND. For more information about tickets, check out <strong><a href=\"https://12go.asia/en/train/hue/da-nang\">12go Asia website</a></strong>.  For people who travel from south, Hoi An is just about 40 km away from Da Nang and you can rent a motorbike, taxi or take a bus. The whole ride won\'t take more than one hour. Hiring a taxi from Hoi An to Da Nang costs from <strong>300,000 - 500,000 VND</strong>. The advice is to always call an official taxi number to <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam\"><strong>avoid common taxi scams</strong></a>. For budget travelers, a direct bus line is by far the best option. The bus costs <strong>30,000 VND and drive lasts for 50 minutes</strong>. The line operates every day from 5:30 am to 6 pm (buses every 20 minutes).  Don\'t forget to plan your visit carefully, since Da Nang officially has two seasons. The prices vary a lot as well as weather, so be sure to check <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/best-time-to-visit-da-nang\"><strong>what is the best time to visit Da Nang</strong></a> before. <h2><strong>Where to Stay - Accommodation Options &amp; Prices</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5304 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da465c3bbb0a.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful view from our hostel\" width=\"1002\" height=\"748\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A stunning view from the rooftop at Fedora Hostel</div>  There are so many accommodation options while traveling to Da Nang. It really depends on your preferences and budget. You can choose between budget hostels, beautiful beach bungalows all the way to luxury hotels and high-end resorts. We stayed in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/fedorahosteldn\"><strong>Fedora hostel</strong></a>, a very comfortable hostel that features capsule beds. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean, the beds were more than comfortable, and they also offer a free breakfast (6 meal options). One night costs <strong>around 90,000 VND</strong> and it\'s located just next to the airport. Probably the best feature of the hostel is a spacious rooftop with stunning views of Son Tra mountain, Hai Van Pass and whole Da Nang city.  Before booking the place, be sure that you\'ve checked <a href=\"https://www.booking.com/\"><strong>Booking.com</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.agoda.com/\"><strong>Agoda</strong></a> since the prices usually differ from platform to platform. You can get a very nice discount on Agoda for high-end hotels. <h2><strong>What to Eat in Da Nang?</strong></h2> Vietnamese cuisine is extremely diverse and you\'ll notice a slight difference in traditional food once you start traveling around the country. Da Nang was formerly a part of today\'s neighboring province Quang Nam which is known for a crazy amount of delicious food. While exploring Da Nang and its surrounding area, be sure that you give your body enough nutrients to keep your energy high. Here are a few local delicacies you have to try while in Da Nang.  We\'ve got lucky to talk with a few travelers who\'ve shared their favorite Vietnamese street food. Feel free to check out the list of <strong><a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-street-food\">Vietnamese street food</a></strong> you have to try. <h3><strong>#1- Mì Quảng</strong></h3> Mì Quảng, originating from a central Vietnamese province Quang Nam, is one of the favorite noodle dishes among travelers and locals. It\'s recognized by its mouthwatering taste around the country, so it\'s not surprising locals eat Mì Quảng on important occasions such as Tet holiday, death anniversaries or family parties. The base of this iconic dish is rice noodles mixed with meat (or seafood), different types of fresh herbs and just a bit of turmeric-infused broth for extra taste. Locals usually use cilantro, onion leaves and basil for a herb mixture. On top of that, expect a nice amount of freshly fried peanuts and rice crackers.  <img class=\"wp-image-5288 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da45a0816892.jpg\" alt=\"A bowl of Mi Quang\" width=\"997\" height=\"667\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A bowl of delicious Mi Quang.</div>  We did try recommended restaurants to find out they serve mediocre Mì Quảng at the best. Since Antonio has a girlfriend who\'s a local in Da Nang, he decided to seek for an authentic local bowl of this iconic dish. There are two places we really enjoy eating our Mì Quảng: <ul>   <li><a href=\"https://www.foody.vn/da-nang/mi-quang-ga-xuan\"><strong>Quan Mi Quang Ba Xuan</strong></a> (completely local place near the airport and a bit on city outskirt)</li>   <li><a href=\"https://www.foody.vn/da-nang/dac-san-mi-quang-dung\"><strong>Mi Quang Dung</strong></a> (a tiny restaurant in a heart of touristic An Thuong area)</li> </ul> <h3><strong>#2- Bún Thịt Nướng</strong></h3> If you\'re a barbeque and peanut e.g. peanut butter lover, then a bowl of fresh Bún thịt nướng is a dish you\'re looking for. It\'s a popular dish around central and south Vietnam, and luckily, Da Nang features one of the best bowls of this iconic dish around its streets. The bowl contains vermicelli noodles topped with fresh herbs (mint and basil), green salad, bean sprouts, peanuts, and cooked peanut sauce. Usually, a delicious and still hot BBQ meat is added along with fish sauce for extra taste. People usually add chili and garlic for an extra treat. Be careful as this dish will make you full without even realizing it.  <img class=\"wp-image-5289 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da45ae2168b8.jpg\" alt=\"Bun Thit Nuong\" width=\"966\" height=\"642\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> By <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/loustejskal/28422843001/in/photolist-nT4z2R-8EXQ8G-2fEugV9-zkJEd4-258x272-2fK9SDr-ji5Vur-Attd74-c5Gwgs-6FFD1B-awSnfG-3cAvsf-rT1nKW-mBr4yN-4JzSzd-dr5FmB-KiCuva-7AmBiL-KiCtHP-KiCuZg-2hers8n\">Lou Stejskal</a> - Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0)</div>  If you\'re on the beachside, head over to Pham Cu Luong street (just a first big street on the left after crossing Tran Ti Ly bridge). There is no specific place we can recommend since the whole street features at least three Bún thịt nướng (and Bánh xèo) places next to each other. The interesting thing is that you\'ll hardly see a foreigner there while locals usually make these tiny restaurants full. Expect to pay <strong>20,000 - 30,000 VND</strong> for a big bowl of this fulfilling dish.  <strong>p.s.</strong> friendly advice is to order Nem Lụi (a grilled meat sausage on a stick) and add it to the combination. Thank us later! ;) <h3><strong>#3- Seafood</strong></h3> Once in Da Nang, you simply can\'t skip a seafood tour! Da Nang is probably the most popular place for eating fresh and diverse seafood in a whole country. Seafood restaurants are often packed till the last seat during almost every night since it\'s rooted deeply in the Danangese culture to drink while enjoying a table of freshly prepared seafood. Once you hit the My Khe beach and walk on Vo Nguyen Giap road, you\'ll see many seafood restaurants. These restaurants have solid and diverse menu, but it comes with a price since these places are mainly visited by tourists from China, Korea or Japan. If you really like the ambient, but the prices are bit too high, just continue following the road to Son Tra (north) until you reach Hoang Sa road. There you\'ll find many seafood restaurants filled with friendly locals and better prices.  Looking for an authentic local experience? Head over to another side of the city and stroll through Duong Nguyen Tat Thanh street. The whole street features stunning views over the local beach and Hai Van pass as well as many seafood restaurants filled with local people.  For a nice seafood dinner for 4 people, you can expect to pay from <strong>500,000 - 1,000,000 VND (if you include drinks)</strong>. Enjoy! <h3><strong>#4- Bánh Xèo</strong></h3> Bánh xèo literally translates to sizzling pancake and the name literally explains this iconic dish. If you\'re a pancake lover you\'ll probably ask where the sizzling comes from. Once the rice batter is thrown in hot oil on a skillet, the sizzling sound is very loud and that\'s where the name comes from. The base of a pancake is made from a mixture of rice flour, turmeric powder, and water. Depending on a restaurant, people usually mix it with small shrimps, different types of meat, beans and bean sprouts. It\'s usually served with mint, basil, and lettuce. Also, you\'ll get a small bowl of hot peanut dipping sauce which just goes great with Bánh xèo.  <img class=\"wp-image-5290 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da45bd1206c1.jpg\" alt=\"Banh Xeo\" width=\"980\" height=\"642\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> By <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/lwy/48715904932/in/photolist-fAMgXy-duiJGy-dukMXw-nEehkT-6DVfPr-C78thY-4r5q9f-rAucbE-duidsh-224k2a8-7mhBEC-H7K5ER-ori2vS-pn5Lm8-dukPWY-ducD2a-duiUSA-dukKgC-ducQAM-dukwyb-dui35L-dudrn6-duiMuW-p1DzQa-6A3kAq-oL65jw-d7iXph-Ewco4-duiSE5-mBQu9K-mBQsxt-FGYRwq-oaqDHG-7TBzrY-6zYeYp-7Tyfxi-oZXXK2-28xhsMp-R4H8Vx-LkHppn-2hervSX-2hervQT-2hespFx-2hervLu-2hdRKio-2hdr9Uh-2hdr7tv-2h9Xwh4-2gnmkuD-xr21ok\">LWYang</a> - Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0)</div>  There are countless Bánh xèo places in Da Nang, but only a few worth mentioning. Head over to Pham Cu Luong street (same as if you\'re looking for a bowl of Bún thịt nướng) and enjoy very delicious Bánh xèo. Another very busy and popular place for enjoying delicious Bánh xèo is <a href=\"https://www.foody.vn/da-nang/banh-xeo-ba-duong\"><strong>Banh Xeo Ba Duong</strong></a>.  Prices for a portion range from <strong>20,000 to 50,000 VND</strong>. <h3><strong>#5- Chè</strong></h3> Once you\'ve finished with heavy and tasty lunch, what would be a better treat than having a traditional Vietnamese dessert - Chè. This iconic desert relates to any sweet Vietnamese dessert such as soup or pudding. Chè is usually made from a mixture of frozen beans, peas, kidney beans, different types of jelly, pieces of fresh fruits, coconut cream and sweetened condensed milk. Expect a sugar rush and sensory overload since Chè usually contains more than 10 different flavors in one cup.  There are multiple street stalls, especially during the night in Da Nang, but there is only one place worth mentioning. The name of a place is <a href=\"https://www.foody.vn/da-nang/che-xuan-trang\"><strong>Che Xuan Tran</strong></a> located on a busy Le Duan street just next to Han Bridge. The prices for Chè vary from <strong>10,000 - 20,000 VND</strong> depending on a number of flavors and fruits (Durian is more expensive but worth trying).  <hr />  Hope you can make use of our 3 days in Da Nang itinerary and have loads of fun while exploring the beauty of the city.

(12745, 3, '2019-10-16 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'Some souvenirs are simply not practical from a space-saving perspective and people started to look for lightweight and portable ideas. Are you thinking to bring traditional souvenirs from Vietnam back home but lacking original ideas? Don\'t worry, we get you covered.  Buying souvenirs in Vietnam is a cultural experience that will introduce you with a diverse, vibrant and rich Vietnamese culture and its regional differences. You can relax in a hammock while an old Vietnamese lady with effortless hand moves makes your conical hat. Or, visit renowned silk tailors who can make any piece of clothing you can possibly imagine. Getting souvenirs will give you a detailed insight into people\'s lives, their struggles, their virtues and the beauty and depth of their culture.  We remember the struggle of getting souvenirs for friends and family. Some items are too big or too fragile for flights, which makes them completely non-practical. Here\'s the list of practical, traditional, and memorable Vietnam souvenirs you can buy around the country. Let\'s do souvenir shopping together. <h2><strong>#1- <em>Nón lá </em>- Vietnamese Conical Hat</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da71015e1da5.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnam Souvenir, Non La Hat\" />  One thing you can hardly miss in Vietnam is their iconic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_conical_hat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">conical hat called <em>Nón lá</em></a>. Locals around the country (especially the countryside) wear <em>Nón lá</em> during the day to protect themselves from the sun or rain, depending on the season.  Did you know that the first appearance of Asian conical hats dates 3,000 years ago?  If you\'re looking to get <em>Nón lá</em> as a gift or souvenir, don\'t worry as you can find these hats everywhere. Locals usually use palm leaves and bamboo to make <em>Nón lá</em> hat.  It\'s interesting how styles differ depending on the region. For instance, in the northern province of Thanh Hoa, people tend to wear a hat featuring a wider frame, while Hue is famous for a thin leaf hat and Binh Dinh for extra small and thick hats.  The best place to get a traditional <em>Nón lá </em>would be Chuong Village that sits just about 30 km from the capital. As we\'ve already mentioned, people can find <em>Nón lá</em> on every step in Vietnam, so don\'t worry if you\'re not visiting villages or the countryside. A visit to any night market will present you with a vast variety of conical hats.  Prices in the market and touristic places vary - <strong>20,000 - 150,000 VND</strong> is what we usually see as the price tag. In the countryside and specialized local shops, the prices won\'t exceed 20,000 VND. <h2>#2- <em>Áo dài</em> - Traditional Vietnamese Dress</h2> <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da7122bd1836.jpg\" alt=\"Souvenirs in Vietnam, Ao Dai\" />  <em>Áo dài</em>, a silk-made traditional long dress, is probably one of the most recognized Vietnam souvenirs you can find. The history of <em>Áo dài</em> dates back to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_dynasty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nguyen dynasty</a> (19th century) who required court people to wear <em>Áo dài</em>.  During a colonization era and 1950s, international designers saw massive potential in <em>Áo dài</em> and decided to create a modern, unisex dress that is known today as <em>Áo dài</em>.  If you ever find yourself wandering around the Old Quarter in Hanoi or the Ancient Town in Hoi An,  you\'ll see mainly Vietnamese women walking around wearing traditional <em>Áo dài</em> with different graphics, colors, and styles. When picking <em>Áo dài</em>, think about the contrast - trousers should contrast a dress color (see on the picture above - red/black combination).  The most popular place for tailoring <em>Áo dài</em> (and other clothes) to your size is Hoi An. Since the town became extremely touristic, prices of tailoring <em>Áo dài</em> climb through the roof, so don\'t forget to negotiate. People usually wear <em>Áo dài</em> during significant holidays, such as <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/tet-holiday-vietnam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tet Holiday</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mid-Autumn festival</a>.  The prices for a tailored <em>Áo dài</em> usually <strong>start at 700,000 VND and can reach 2,000,000 VND</strong> depending on the fabrics, colors, graphics, and shop. <h2>#3- <em>Thuốc lào</em> - Tobacco Bong</h2> <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da7126ec103f.jpg\" alt=\"Thuoc Lao, our favorite Vietnamese souvenir\" />  <em>Thuốc lào</em>, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotiana_rustica\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nicotiana Rustica</a>, is a particular sort of tobacco that contains up to 10 times more nicotine than the regular one. It\'s fascinating how a tobacco bong ritual can be found only in the northern provinces while it\'s tough to see anyone smoking <em>Thuốc lào</em> in the south. Locals love to get a nicotine hit from a bong after a big lunch accompanied by a cup of Vietnamese coffee and herbal tea.  Since tobacco is powerful, people usually feel dizzy or high after inhaling through the pipe. Never take massive hits from the beginning, but instead start small and slowly increase.  <em>Thuốc lào</em> is a term for unique tobacco, while a water bong is called Dieu cay or Dieu bat, depending on the material.  As we\'ve already mentioned, the best place to find a pipe and tobacco is Hanoi, Thanh Hoa (best tobacco by locals), and Nghe An provinces.  Prices may vary, but expect to pay <strong>around 200,000 VND</strong> for a bamboo or metal pipe and up to 700,000 for a wooden one (which might be harder to carry it back home since border regulations). <h2>#4- Traditional Vietnamese Coffee &amp; Coffee Phin</h2> <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da712d077ed8.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnamese coffee with a view in Laos\" />  What would be a better souvenir from Vietnam than delicious and potent coffee? Did you know that Vietnam is the second-largest coffee exporter in the world? Well, that says everything about the <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-coffee-culture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">coffee in Vietnam</a>.  Once you set your feet in Vietnam, you\'ll see coffee everywhere. Locals are talking with sips of strong coffee and tea, a coffee scent on each step, and booming of cafe shops. Coffee in Vietnam is rooted in culture.  Vietnam mainly produces Robusta beans, but Arabica can be found in the Highlands, especially around Da Lat and Buon Ma Thuot, which is regarded as the capital of coffee in Vietnam. We recommend visiting local farms and families producing coffee in the Highlands if you\'re looking to bring coffee back home.  The prices from the farms usually start at <strong>100,000 VND for 200 grams</strong> of packed coffee beans. In the markets and shops (Big C, Vincom, locals markets), you can get Trung Nguyen for about 70,000 VND (350g).  Don\'t forget to get a coffee phin (filter) for about 30,000 VND that will make a <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">delicious Vietnamese coffee</a>. <h2>#5- <em>Guốc Mộc </em>- Traditional Wooden Footwear</h2> Wearing wooden traditional footwear in Vietnam dates from Nguyen dynasty times when people started to wear <em>Áo dài</em>, <em>Nón lá</em> and famous <em>Guốc Mộc</em>. The beautiful and oldfashioned wooden shoes can be seen on Vietnamese women during special occasions such as the Tet Holiday celebration, Mid Autumn Festival, or similar.  The history of wooden footwear in Vietnam is fascinating since farmers were mainly working barefoot until the Tran dynasty in the 15th century. Did you know that indigenous people living in Cao Bang province (near China border) wear stone clogs? During the Nguyen dynasty, wooden clogs became mainstream footwear among wealthy people, and soon after August Revolution in 1945., the first factory for producing wooden clogs was opened in Hue. The rest is history.  Nowadays, we had a chance to see older women wearing <em>Guốc Mộc</em> while driving around Nghe An countryside. Apart from that, I\'ve seen plenty of artistic traditional footwear in Hoi An during the Mid Autumn Festival (authenticity is questionable).  You can get your hands on wooden clogs around the Old District in Hanoi or Benh Thanh Market in Saigon or the Ancient Town in Hoi An. You can expect to pay around <strong>250,000 VND</strong> in these touristic places for a pair of wooden clogs. <h2>#6- Silk</h2> <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da715f709657.jpg\" alt=\"Colorful Silk in Vietnam\" />  Silk might remind you as a luxury, but the times when the elite and royal family only wore silk were far behind us. These days you can find loads of silk products, long dress (Ao Dai), shirts, and much more on the markets and stores. For instance, Hoi An is widely recognized by tailors who\'re going to make beautiful and elegant clothes from silk for your size.  Are you looking to buy high-quality silk in Vietnam? Head over to Silk Street (Hang Gai Street) in Hanoi\'s Old District, and you\'ll be surrounded by hundreds of small shops and silk vendors. In Hoi An, there is a popular Cocoon Silk store that not only specializes in selling silk but also educates people about silk and its history. Other great places to buy silk are Cam Chau (Silk Village around Hoi An), and Toan Thinh Silk in Saigon.  Expect to pay around <strong>100,000 VND per meter of Vietnam silk</strong>. <h2>#7- Herbal Tea</h2> <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da716902646b.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnamese tea is a perfect souvenir\" />  Did you know that Vietnamese tea is considered as a hobby of older people? You see, you can\'t miss getting some tea as a souvenir from Vietnam back home!  There are many different types of tea consumed in Vietnam and the most popular are lotus, jasmine, and green tea. It\'s not surprising that wherever you go to Vietnam, you\'ll see people, young and old, enjoying green tea while socializing.  The best place to buy tea is by far Thai Nguyen province (around 150km north from Hanoi). If you don\'t go there, try your luck in Lai Cau or Da Lat.  Jasmine and green tea costs about <strong>50,000 VND per 100 grams, while Lotus tea can reach 1,000,000 VND for 100 grams</strong>.  We bought a delicious tea (don\'t know what it was) in Trang An area (Ninh Binh province) from our guest house. The tea was a mixture of many herbs, roots, and leaves, but the majority of people in that area consume tea like that. We remember it was the most delicious tea we\'ve ever tried. The price was around <strong>200,000 VND for around 100 grams</strong>. <h2>#8- Do Paper Postcards</h2> <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da717063a40d.jpg\" alt=\"Do Paper postcards\" />  Do Paper is a particular type of paper made from the inner layer of do trees. This paper had a crucial role in Vietnamese tradition and history since the folk artists throughout history were painting the historical moments and events on this paper. Nowadays, do paper isn\'t widely used, but relevant documents, books, and valuable paintings are still printed on it. The most famous art made on Do paper is by far Dong Go painting.  Sometimes, it can be tough to find a store that sells do paper, but don\'t worry, we have you covered. Head over to Craft Link or small shops on Hang Gai in Hanoi\'s Old District. There you can get traditional postcards, notebooks, shiny pictures, greeting cards, and much more for the price <strong>starting at 30,000 VND</strong>.  <strong>p.s. </strong>If you\'re looking for digitalized postcards from Vietnam, don\'t hesitate to check our <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/postcards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>postcard page</strong></a>. Also, we\'re creating digital postcards on demand, in case you\'re looking for something creative and original. :) <h2>#9- Traditional Hand Embroidery</h2> <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da717a0d3891.jpg\" alt=\"Traditional hand embroidery\" />  Hand embroidery is rooted in Vietnamese culture so deep that even Vietnamese ancestors liked to say: <h4><em>\"Men read books and recite poems. Women have to do embroidery and sewing.\"</em></h4> You can find literally anything embroidered, including sheets, quilts, pillowcases, table runners, bags, sleep dresses, and much more. The majority of embroidered products differ in prices, quality, and material, so pay extra attention while buying. For instance, locals tend to buy hand embroidery made from cotton or silk as they believe it\'s the best.  If you\'re heading to Sa Pa or norther provinces where ethnic minorities live, be sure to take a visit around the villages and support their hard work. Embroidery from the north is arguably the best and most durable.  Buying embroidery in Hanoi is effortless and can be found around Hoan Kiem lake. Check out Hang Gai street and Hang Da Market (2nd floor) for creative handmade embroidery products.  <strong><em>Expect to pay up to 300,000 VND for bed sheets, up to 150,000 VND for a handbag and around 200,000 VND for napkins.</em></strong> <h2>#10- Traditional Musical Instruments</h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5915 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e8248704cb98.jpg\" alt=\"Traditional Vietnamese musical instrument\" width=\"977\" height=\"650\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Traditional Vietnamese musical instruments by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/shankaronline/30645928923/in/photolist-NG5oYT-bCYdna-M82a1m-TuiPfM-NG5Z4B-DM7niZ-bNFCoF-2pgZnD-NG5ppn-XkNdy3-4KvLhs-edNvW1-xzPviC-rWbSq-xzPw4W-wVxTk8-BRN7Y-ifb2tA-EkSe23-4EH5zK-2hobVK3-2phcsM-2hob8MA-cdnPeJ-2hob8ij-bW2SXu-grMNyh-ayPe2Y-QsciXX-ayPfgu-qXYXr1-ayPdTs-8c5sHe-PKg2kn-KTGPBL-n1utD-rzGZ3A-ayPeXq-jFsZf-8c8MKY-oCFKc-ayPevL-ayPec5-ayPeNs-ayLzdg-ayPeEU-6eNvgC-ayLyrp-8c5sDg-Qm9AZC\">Shankar S.</a> Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0)</div>  Music plays a huge role in the life of the Vietnamese people. Once you stay in Vietnam for a while, you\'ll soon realize that almost anyone plays at least one musical instrument. I was positively surprised when walking through tiny streets in Hanoi or Da Nang and hear uplifting local music. People tend to gather, get tasty local food, and play guitars, and other musical instruments. Also, they always encourage people to join them, so how to say no to that?  During my time in Vietnam, I\'ve learned to play the guitar and I actually bought one. You can find musical shops on each step, even in smaller places and the prices are reasonable. I\'ve got my first acoustic guitar (Chinese version) for around 1,500,000 VND (around $65) which is a nice deal.  Anyway, chances you have someone in the family who\'s passionate about the music are high, so getting a musical instrument would be a nice gift from Vietnam.  <strong>The best musical instruments that go as handy souvenirs from Vietnam are:</strong> <ul>   <li>bamboo flutes (schoolkids usually play it!)</li>   <li>xylophones</li>   <li>miniature Trong Com (a colorful Vietnamese drum)</li> </ul> Since these instruments are made from different types of wood, be sure to check with your airline and immigration since some materials are restricted. I faced a problem of bringing a wooden Thuoc Lao (tobacco bong) when I was coming back to Croatia but was happy that my girlfriend could take it.  When buying Vietnam souvenirs, the best places to check are the main local markets. Each town or city has its market where you can find anything, from food and souvenirs, to live animals and motorbikes. You name it.  If you\'re in Hanoi, head over to Dong Xuan Market. In Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), you should go to Ben Thanh Market, while in Da Nang it\'s Han Market. For smaller places, just do a search on Google Maps and look for Chợ - a Vietnamese word for the local market.  The prices for musical instruments start at 30,000 VND and can easily reach 2 million VND. Always bargain! <h2><strong>#11- Chopsticks</strong></h2> <p id=\"PyHNxfb\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5911 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e82461eaadf7.jpg\" alt=\"You can\'t miss with chopsticks. One of the most authentic Vietnam souvenirs.\" width=\"1179\" height=\"870\" /></p> Vietnamese food is extremely diverse, but rice stays staple food. If you\'ve ever eaten with a Vietnamese family, then you know how much rice they eat. I\'ve been living with a local Vietnamese family for more than 4 months, and I can\'t remember a single day without a bowl of rice. As a soup goes perfectly with a spoon, the rice goes well with chopsticks.  I don\'t know anyone who didn\'t start to use chopsticks on a daily basis after returning from Vietnam. You can\'t miss with a set of traditional chopsticks.  You can find basic chopsticks at any local market for the price of 10,000 VND. I\'ve bought a whole wooden set (around 10 pairs) for about 20,000 VND. If you want to be fancy while eating, aim for metal chopsticks or the ones with the art such as dragons. <h2><strong>#12- Vietnam T-Shirts</strong></h2> I simply love Vietnamese t-shirts! Buying t-shirts is a whole experience for itself since there are so many options to choose from. While buying Vietnam souvenirs, you can\'t miss by getting one, or two or ten t-shirts. Since Vietnam is one of the biggest manufacturers in the world, it\'s not strange that the t-shirt market is enormous!  You can find t-shirts in various colors, sizes, text, graphics, funny slogans. During our last trip, we initially planned to spend around an hour at Ben Thanh Market in Saigon, but we stayed the whole afternoon. Be careful as your wallet will get smaller and smaller - it\'s addictive.  p.s. the prices vary, but I\'d say an average for a printed t-shirt is about 100,000 VND. Don\'t forget to bargain as locals are masters in getting a better price from you.  <strong>Here are some of the best catches during our shopping:</strong> <p id=\"oyLcEpB\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5912 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e82476ee60bb.jpg\" alt=\"Funny Vietnamese t-shirt vol.1\" width=\"1263\" height=\"912\" /></p> <p id=\"rDFLjfl\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5913 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e8247a0ef86f.jpg\" alt=\"Funny Vietnamese t-shirt vol.2\" width=\"1226\" height=\"923\" /></p> <p id=\"IJgldYt\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5914 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e8247e66585c.jpg\" alt=\"Funny Vietnamese t-shirt vol.3\" width=\"1279\" height=\"911\" /></p> We hope our list of 12 souvenirs from Vietnam will help you in deciding what kind of traditional product you\'d like to bring home. There are still many other conventional products you can take as souvenirs, but we didn\'t mention all since some are too big or heavy to be practical for transportation.

(12746, 3, '2019-11-06 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'Nakai, one of the first places I\'ve visited during my first Laos trip, instantly became my home where I\'ve met my second family. At first glance, Nakai looks like a tiny village with not many interesting things to do, but after staying there for a month, I\'ve had a chance to explore the beauty this place has to offer. You won\'t see many foreigners around, just a few who\'re doing a famous Thakhek loop since Nakai is one of the stops on the loop. Locals are extremely friendly and you can hear <em>\'Sabaidee\'</em> followed with a beautiful wide smile on every step.  I\'ve been to Nakai twice and plan to visit this beautiful place many times in the future. What\'s special about this tiny town in the middle of central Laos? Let\'s check out the most amazing things to do in Nakai. <h2><strong>#1- Enjoy Delicacies From Local Market</strong></h2> <p id=\"yzjFAFe\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5437 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc18f9e7900e.jpg\" alt=\"Sunset over a small local market.\" width=\"1064\" height=\"783\" /></p> Lao people love to say if there is a market, it\'s a town. In the town center there is a small market where you can get various goods including fabrics, toys, candies, prepared meals, drinks, fresh vegetables, fruit and much more. Pretty much like any countryside market in Laos. Oh not to forget, there is a non-recognizable bus station with daily lines to Laxsao (near Vietnam border) or Thakhek.  A local market is one of the main drivers of the economy in Nakai. I\'ve tasted many delicacies on the market, but by far the most delicious are local-made meals. You have a few pots with a cooked dish, so you can pick whatever suits you. Fried vegetables with beef is my favorite. Also, every food stand tends to have the same food, but sometimes the food differs in freshness, so I recommend not buying all the food from the same vendor. That way, not only you\'re getting the freshest food, but also you\'re financially supporting more families.  You can\'t miss with fried chicken or liver on a stick and of course, a bowl of their sticky rice. You can expect to pay 5,000 LAK for each dish, so I was spending about 20,000 LAK per day on food in Nakai (around $3). <h2><strong>#2- Visit Open Nakai English School</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5425 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc186bd250f6.jpg\" alt=\"My students in Laos.\" width=\"1066\" height=\"794\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> This was the picture from my last day in Laos with my students. I\'ve had a chance to meet all of them on my second visit. Some of them stopped studying, some of them improved so much. I\'m very happy for them and looking forward to seeing them again.</div>  The main reason I\'ve found myself in Nakai, in the first, place was volunteering at Open Nakai English School. The school started as the idea of a young and energetic man called Thon who\'ve learned English while working in a local resort. He recognized how many opportunities opened his way once he was able to clearly communicate in English, so he decided to start his own classes to teach young students English.  When I\'ve first arrived, I was stunned how much dedication this man has since, at that time, he was working three different jobs. His brother in law, Khen is the second teacher who focuses on teaching younger students. They have a huge family and I can say they became my Lao family. We usually eat lunch and dinner together that features traditional Lao food including their staple, sticky rice combined with bamboo soups, diverse vegetables, fish, sometimes fried crickets, snails and ant\'s eggs. You can really experience a life of a local Lao family while staying with them and if you\'re doing Thakhek loop, be sure to check out his place.  <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g49vdI2UMx0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  After the first visit, I wanted to introduce my Lao family to my girlfriend, so we visited my family again and had a blast.  In case you\'d like to experience teaching and living in Laos countryside, <a href=\"https://www.workaway.info/en/host/988244659799\">here</a> you can find a project on Workaway. If you need any help or would love to hear more about the project, please don\'t hesitate to reach me out. <h2><strong>#3- Try a Spicy Papaya Salad</strong></h2> Whenever I asked my students about their favorite food, I\'ve always got pretty much the same answer - spicy papaya salad. It\'s important to mention that Lao food is probably the spiciest food I had a chance to eat. They make everything extremely spicy and they love it!  I\'ve decided to try their specialty on the local market and I must tell it\'s very delicious...and spicy. If you\'re not used to spicy food, tell a friendly lady who makes food to not put many chili peppers. After a while, I was eating papaya salad with more than 10 chili peppers inside.  It\'s very funny how locals are very judgemental about the blend or mixture in papaya salad. It\'s the most important part, and the secret of delicious papaya salad since locals mix spices, herbs and sauces together. The quantities and ratios are crucial to Lao people and after a few papaya salads, I could tell the difference between the blends. <h2><strong>#4- Watch the Sunset From Ghost Boat</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5436 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc18ed3d53c3.jpg\" alt=\"Watching sunset at Ghost Boat.\" width=\"1062\" height=\"795\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> I\'ve found some beautiful girl and couldn\'t hesitate to take this photo.</div>  Sunsets in Laos are very special, unique and different. I had a habit of watching sunsets from different spots every day while I was in Laos. During my first visit (dry season) you couldn\'t see a single cloud in the sky and sunsets looked spectacular. In the low season, it\'s the same thing. Probably everyone who\'s ever been to Laos will say the same. You simply don\'t want to miss a beautiful Lao sunset.  One of the best places to observe the sunset in Nakai is from their Ghost Boat. During the high season, the sunk boat becomes a restaurant where you can order drinks, local specialties (papaya salad is very good there) and enjoy the sunset. I recommend taking a seat on the top of the boat and ordering a cold Beer Lao while enjoying the sunset. Thank me later. :) <h2><strong>#5- Boat Racing Festival</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5440 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc1917812810.jpg\" alt=\"Boat racing festival in Laos.\" width=\"589\" height=\"506\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A blue team preparing for the race.</div>  If you\'re visiting Laos in late September or early October, don\'t miss the chance to watch the craziness of the boat racing festival (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boun_Suang_Huea\">Boun Suang Heua</a>). The biggest events and races take place in the northern city of Luang Prabang, but you can experience boat festivals around the villages and towns that sit on the Mekong river.  During the boat racing festival, Nakai completely transforms from a laidback village to a dynamic place (in Laos countryside context) where local families are outside with their kids while getting involved in various activities. There are many stands where you can buy imported and locally made goods, play some games, sing karaoke, try Laos delicacies, and of course, enjoy cold Beer Lao in huge quantities.  It\'s a two-day festival where locals form racing teams who compete against each other in boat rowing on the lake. The energy is simply amazing and you don\'t want to miss this festival. Also, after the final race, there is a huge party in the form of a concert where locals have a lot of fun and way too many beers. The funniest thing about partying in Laos is that people start very early, always bottoms up the beers and go home extremely early.  <img class=\"wp-image-5438 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc19078327f9.jpg\" alt=\"Nakai market during the boat racing festival.\" width=\"579\" height=\"718\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Strolling through the market. Khen is very funny with his umbrella, but it makes sense since it\'s crazy hot.</div>  The family and my girlfriend left so early, so I\'ve decided to just enjoy and drink a bit more. Instantly, I\'ve met a few local friends who were my dancing and drinking partners through the night. Also, we didn\'t understand each other a single thing, but it was a great time! Oh yeah, not to forget, I was hungover for the following three days! :) <h2><strong>#6- Swim Around Song Sou Waterfall</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5430 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc18c2a9ef46.jpg\" alt=\"Song Sou Waterfall\" width=\"593\" height=\"769\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> As you can see, the actual waterfall is a few hundred meters away from the lake.</div>  Song Sou waterfall is just 3 km away from controversial Nam Theun 2 power station and touristic (not so) visitor center. Before reaching the power station you\'ll encounter a small bridge with an unpaved path on the left and a sign to a waterfall. It\'s interesting that the Lao government started to \'invest\' in tourism, so you can see a sign here and there leading you to an attraction.  Just follow the road for about a kilometer and you\'ll encounter a security guy who takes care of parking. The cost of parking is 5,000 LAK. You have to walk for about 5 minutes until you reach a small lake where you can jump from rocks and swim. The waterfall is a bit behind and I\'ve never gone near the waterfall since you have to climb and it\'s not the greatest idea to do it in flip flops.  Anyways, during my first visit in March, the stream from a waterfall was not existent and the lake was very low but still good for swimming. It\'s a great place to enjoy the beautiful nature, get some sun or barbeque and enjoy swimming in a cold, but extremely clear water.  <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bCHI6tvEOrM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  One anecdote from my first visit. I was very scared to jump in the lake at first since every time you put the leg or arm in the water, there are hundreds of fish around. These fish are harmless, but the crazy amount of them just scared me off. <h2><strong>#7- Go Camping</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5441 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc1920ba2c80.jpg\" alt=\"Camping in Nakai.\" width=\"1068\" height=\"770\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> A camping site during the sunset.</div>  Nam Theun reservoir features a massive lake with countless beautiful places to camp. I\'ve bring my tent from Vietnam, but there are a few renting options in local resorts. I recommend just going around the lake and find a suitable place for you. You don\'t have to worry about the officials or other people since this area isn\'t densely populated, so if you set up your tent a bit away from the road, you\'ll probably won\'t see anyone around except fishermen driving their longboats.  Be careful with the fire, especially during the dry season as everything is extremely dry and burns like crazy. I\'ve never experienced a campfire that big! Don\'t forget to take a mosquito repellent since you\'ll most likely be somewhere near the lake. We were catching snails and eels during the night and prepared them for dinner on a fire. I really don\'t recommend doing it since snails can have different parasites that can be extremely dangerous for your body.  I was very lucky that I\'ve got not so serious form of parasites (Fasciola), but it made huge complications and scars on my liver. Be extra careful about the food from the lake and drinking water in Laos. <h2><strong>#8- Hike to Pha Katai Viewpoint</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5432 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc18d2ee56ec.jpg\" alt=\"Top of Pha Katai.\" width=\"1067\" height=\"768\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> That\'s the view from the top of Pha Katai mountain.</div>  Around 25 km south of Nakai town, there is a beautiful limestone mountain just next to the river and the road. Pha Katai is the name of that mountain and you can climb using furnished metal steps all the way to the top where you can relax in a covered hut and enjoy stunning views. At the very beginning of a trail, there is a small house where you have to pay for an entrance.  The first time I\'ve climbed, I paid 10,000 LAK and the second time they asked 20,000 per person, but since we didn\'t have a small change, they\'ve let us climb for 8,000 LAK. It means you can definitely bargain for the price since 20,000 sounds very expensive knowing that the majority of surrounding attractions cost less than 10,000 LAK.  There are around 700 steep red stairs that sometimes move while you\'re walking. It\'s definitely scary at some points. The whole hike takes about 20 minutes and it\'s definitely a great training.  <img class=\"wp-image-5433 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc18db9d3cdb.jpg\" alt=\"Stairs from Pha Katai.\" width=\"591\" height=\"775\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Infamous (not so red anymore) stairs.</div> <h2><strong>#9- Nam Theun 2 Visitor Center</strong></h2> Located just next to Nam Theun 2 Power Station, a visitor center shows the history of dam construction, relocations and positive results the hydro plant has on a community. It\'s very interesting to see how biased all the information is since they completely neglect the environmental effects, a negative impact on downstream communities, mighty relocation of indigenous people (around 7,000 people) and continual failure of elevating poverty.  If you\'re about to hit the Song Sou waterfall, then checking an <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Nam-Theun-2-Visitor-Center-506683322812427/\">NT2 Visitor Center</a> should be on your list. It\'s pretty confusing when it comes to opening time as I\'ve never had a luck to visit the center since it was always closed (even in the opening time?). <h2><strong>#10- Wander Around Nam Theun Reservoir</strong></h2> <p id=\"PdGkpQt\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5439 aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc190c7173e1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p> In 2008., during the wet season, the reservoir was created by flooding one of the latest remaining diverse jungles with a crucial impact on the ecosystem in central Laos. In the area of the current reservoir, more than 6,000 were forced to relocate to make the place for a gigantic dam project. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nam_Theun_2_Dam\">Nam Theun Reservoir</a> is a massive lake and it\'s hard to see its end when you\'re wandering around. If you ignore the historical facts and consequences the reservoir has on the environment and livelihood of locals, it looks spectacular! The very beautiful and at the same time sad feature is a dead forest that can be seen all around the reservoir.  Currently, there are a few boat tours operating in the reservoir where you can experience the biodiversity that\'s left. There are still many villages on the skirts of the lake that don\'t have access to basic infrastructures such as electricity, schools or roads. It\'s very awesome to see local communities adapting to a new lifestyle (it\'s discussable if it\'s a successful adaptation). I recommend you to sit somewhere near the lake during the sunset as that\'s the time the majority of fishermen come back home. You can capture amazing shots during this time. <h2><strong>#11- Explore Villages on the Way to Kong Lor Cave</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5428 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc1899e6c9ea.jpg\" alt=\"Villages on the way to Kong Lor Cave.\" width=\"1065\" height=\"799\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Kong Lor Cave in the distance. There is still more than 20 km to Kong Lor Cave that is located somewhere in the middle of mountains ahead.</div>  Kong Lor cave is an extremely popular destination for travelers who\'re doing Thakhek loop. It\'s located about 60 km from Nakai town and you can expect a real adventure driving a motorbike there. Prepare yourself for a rough and unpaved road that will lead you to the top of the mountain and then you\'ll slowly descend into the beautiful valley. On the way to the valley, there is a beautiful waterfall where you can rest a bit and simply enjoy the view. A valley features numerous traditional villages where locals mainly live from farming, livestock, and logging.  In the villages, you can stop for the food, but during my visit, I had a few bananas so I haven\'t stopped. There are many unpaved roads around so you can just get lost and wander around the beautiful place. The roads aren\'t marked on the maps, but you can navigate by locating the highest mountain (the one you\'ve come from). <h2><strong>#12- Climb the Orchid Path</strong></h2> The Orchid Path is an off-the-beaten hike about 10 km north from Nakai, just next to the way to Kong Lor cave. The whole hike is about 900 m long and it will take about 20 minutes to reach the final viewpoint. Since this hike is just next to the main road, be sure to lock your bike properly. There is a security guy on the entrance, but don\'t rely much on him. Once you reach the top, you\'ll be greeted with stunning views over the reservoir featuring countless islands, dead forests, and mountains in a distance. <h2><strong>#13- Explore Resettlement Areas</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5427 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc18866af774.jpg\" alt=\"NT2 Resettlement area\" width=\"1069\" height=\"777\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> One of many resettlement villages around the NT2 reservoir. The road in the village (behind the table) is paved, but to reach the village, you have to prepare for an offroad adventure. :)</div>  Since the big flooding to make the place for a reservoir in 2008., more than 6,000 people were resettled to newly made villages with \'better\' infrastructure. There are around 15 resettlement villages around the area that you can visit from Nakai town. I\'ve visited a few since I was very curious about the life these people live nowadays. It\'s true that infrastructure is better now since these people were living in the thick jungle and right now, they can reach Nakai and other towns through unpaved roads. The kids can attend the schools, but the problem is that the schools are far away and the transportation costs are high and usually unaffordable for an average family whose well-being depends on a depleting reservoir.  Despite difficulties, these people seem to live a very relaxed life enjoying a mid-day nap in their hammocks. Also, their smiles and friendly gestures were memorable. It\'s definitely my recommendation to visit at least one of these villages.  <hr />  As you can see, Nakai is a relatively small town in the middle of nowhere, but there are many beautiful things to do in Nakai. If you\'re doing Thakhek loop, be sure to stop, explore beautiful things around, enjoy spicy traditional food and share memorable moments with friendly locals.', '13 Amazing Things to Do in Nakai, Laos', 'TODO: Write Excerpt\r\n', 'draft', 'open', 'open', '', '', '', '', '2019-11-06 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', 0, 'http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/?p=12746', 0, 'post', '', 0),

I usually don\'t drink, but I\'m not saving any money when it comes to coffee and other soft drinks.  <table class=\'danang_living_costs\'>         <tr>                 <th>Cost Type</th>                 <th>Cost</th>         </tr>         <tr>                 <td>Accommodation (a studio apartment)</td>                 <td>$200</td>         </tr>         <tr>                 <td>Food & Drinks</td>                 <td>$200</td>         </tr>         <tr>                 <td>Transportation (gas, maintenance, grab)</td>                 <td>$40</td>         </tr>         <tr>                 <td>Visa (every three months)</td>                 <td>$90</td>         </tr>         <tr>                 <td>Travel Insurance</td>                 <td>$30</td>         </tr>         <tr>                 <td>Entertainment (alcohol, music, movies, books, etc.)</td>                 <td>$20</td>         </tr>         <tr>                 <td>Internet Data Plan</td>                 <td>$4</td>         </tr>         <tr>                 <td>Household Items</td>                 <td>$20</td>         </tr>         <tr>                 <td>Total</td>                 <td>$604</td>         </tr> </table>  As you can see, on average, I spend roughly $900 every month. I\'m spending more during the dry season (more electricity and water, slightly higher prices, etc.).  <strong>p.s. </strong>Please take my apologies for the ugly looking table! I hope you aren\'t so critical and it helps you with data. :) <h2><strong>Affordable Accommodation </strong></h2> Probably the first and the most important aspect of expat life is finding the right fitting apartment. Since Da Nang is going through the crazy development phase, construction sites and new hotels/motels (Nhà Nghỉ) are everywhere. It has its good and bad sides. The choices are endless, but it comes with the constant construction noise which is sometimes overwhelming.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5485\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.apartment-in-danang.jpg\" alt=\"My apartment in Da Nang\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> This is my small apartment in the An Thuong area. It\'s a loft with a bed and TV upstair and a small bathroom behind the curtain. I have everything I need here for around $250/month.</div>  I\'m living in an Airbnb room on the beachside - An Thuong area. The monthly rental costs me roughly <strong>5 million VND (around $250)</strong> with all utilities included. It\'s a good bargain for the area, but it comes with some downsides such as small space, no cleaning services, construction sites around, etc. Anyway, I\'ve been staying there for more than 6 months and I\'m pretty happy with it.  The main advice when it comes to apartment-hunting is to rent for a few nights to check it out first. I\'ve met many expats who\'ve rented the apartment at first sight and ended up being surrounded by mighty karaoke bars and construction sites. Check Airbnb for the potential prospects, book a few nights and see it yourself.  <em>There are also various Facebook groups where Vietnamese people post different apartment prospects each day, so it might be a great lead:</em> <ul>          <li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/79917573655/\">Da Nang Hoi An Expats</a></li>          <li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/danangrent/\">Da Nang Apartments &amp; Rooms</a></li> </ul> Just write a post about your needs and budget and soon your inbox will be full with offers from agents.  From my experience, the prices on the beachside for a <strong>single-room apartment/studio average from $200 - $450/month</strong>. In the Hai Chau district (on the other side, or riverside) the prices are slightly higher. Probably the cheapest option is to connect with expats and figure out a shared house.  Looking for interesting things to do while you\'re finding your apartment? Read our <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/3-days-in-da-nang\">3 days in Da Nang itinerary</a> and get the vibe of the city. <h2><strong>Food Heaven</strong></h2> Da Nang offers a lively and diverse food scene where the choices are endless. There are various traditional dishes originating from central Vietnam that you can find on the streets in Da Nang. In general, there are three options for eating: western restaurants, street food and cooking your own food.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5494\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.rice-buffet.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnamese street food\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> This is a rice buffet you can find around the city. You get a plate of rice and then you pick the food. For a huge meal, you can expect to pay up to 30,000 VND.</div>  Local Vietnamese food is extremely fresh, delicious and affordable. For example, Bánh mì (sandwich with eggs and meat) costs around 15,000 VND, a bowl of Phở around 30,000 VND, a rice buffet (Cơm Bình Dân) will set you full for about 25,000 VND. A huge meal with a drink on the side won\'t exceed 50,000 VND. It\'s important to mention that local food isn\'t vegetarian-friendly, but there are options. Look for \'Chay\' places which means vegetarian food. I\'ve found a very nice vegetarian rice buffet in An Thuong area that will set you for 25,000 VND.  Western restaurants are way more expensive and I\'ve found out the food isn\'t that fresh. Some people would argue about the cleanness of street food compared to restaurants, but I\'ve never had a single health problem with street food (knocking on the table).  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5488\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.food-local-market.jpg\" alt=\"Mi Quang on Han Market\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> This is a delicious Mi Quang from Han Market in the process of making. It\'s an iconic dish from Central Vietnam (Quang Nam province).</div>  If you decide to cook your own food, you can\'t miss with local markets. Local markets feature friendly vendors selling the freshest ingredients for affordable prices. It\'s crucial that you know the average prices for the food since sellers will usually charge you more for ingredients than usual. You can always negotiate about the prices, especially if you know the average price which will help you not losing the face and being disrespectful. Locals love a good round of bargaining. I love to go for grocery shopping at My An market or Han market. You can find many souvenirs, clothes, kitchen things, traditional cuisine, and more there.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5492\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.local-market-in-danang.jpg\" alt=\"Local market in Da Nang\" width=\"1024\" height=\"609\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Getting lost around the local market in Da Nang. You can buy literally anything here, but be ready for bargaining!</div> <h2><strong>Ways of Transportation</strong></h2> Da Nang features a developed infrastructure that offers various transportation options. If you\'re planning to travel abroad, the international airport sits straight in the city and you can score direct flight lines around Asia for great prices. Once you\'re in the city, the motorbike is the king. I\'ve bought a used Honda Wave for 7 million VND ($300) and drove it for more than a year. Don\'t forget to check every detail on your bike while buying. We\'ve written a detailed guide for <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam\">buying a bike in Vietnam</a>, so check it out. If you\'re looking to buy a motorbike or bicycle or simply anything second-hand, head over to <a href=\"https://www.chotot.com/\">ChoTot</a>, a Vietnamese online marketplace.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5495\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.transport-danang.jpg\" alt=\"Traffic in Da Nang\" width=\"1024\" height=\"611\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Traffic can\'t be compared to Saigon or Hanoi, but there are some congestions during rush hours. Avoid these hours if possible.</div>  Traffic is chaotic at times, especially during the rush hours (7 - 9 am and 4 - 6 pm), but you can\'t compare it to traffic in Saigon or Hanoi. There are also many rental places offering monthly rentals for around 1 million VND.  Please note that it\'s necessary to have an international driving license or a local one (easy process if you have a car driving license in your home country). Also, if you drive a bike with an <strong>engine smaller than 50cc you don\'t need a license</strong> (see Honda Cub 50). Police started to enforce it lately, so be sure you\'re driving legally not only because of the police but in case of an accident your insurance won\'t cover you. You can read our detailed guide on getting a <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-driving-license\">lifetime Vietnamese driving license</a>.  The liter of gas costs around 20,000 VND and scooters usually pass around 30 km on one liter. I love to drive around, so I spend around 100,000 - 200,000 VND per week on gasoline. Don\'t forget to include the cost of bike maintenance here which is usually changing the oil (around 100,000 VND every 1,000 km).  Probably the best and most convenient way of transportation is Grab. You can get from the main bus station to the beach for 60,000 VND. Shorter rides will cost you not more than 20,000 VND. If you don\'t have the proper documents for driving the bike, go with Grab or bicycle. You can find a used bicycle for 600,000 VND and it will serve you just well (not for long distances). Also, don\'t forget to check other <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/mobile-apps-vietnam\">useful mobile apps</a> that will help you during your time in Vietnam.  <img class=\"wp-image-5496 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc3c20d6e03e.jpg\" alt=\"Driving a motorbike around Da Nang\" width=\"996\" height=\"729\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> There are many beautiful roads around Da Nang. I really love to drive to the top of Hai Van pass where you have stunning views over Da Nang City.</div>  There are also a few taxi companies and public buses, but I\'ve never used any of these. <a href=\"https://www.danangbus.vn/roadmap.html\">Here</a> you can find a detailed bus route map with stations and prices. Also, we\'ve written a detailed <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/public-transportation-in-vietnam\">public transportation guide</a>, so it might be a good read. <h2><strong>Co-Working Spaces &amp; Cafes</strong></h2> If you work remotely, there is a pretty diverse selection of work-friendly cafes around Da Nang. I\'ve been already writing about <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/working-cafes-in-da-nang\">working cafes in Da Nang</a>, so be sure to check out my favorite cafes where you can get some creative and uninterrupted work done. I\'m not a huge fan of coworking spaces, but there are a few popular places around the city, mainly in the city center (riverside). The prices vary from place to place, but an average daily pass is around 150,000 VND which includes coffee/tea and water. <strong> </strong>  Working cafes usually feature a stable and fast internet, ergonomic tables and chairs, loads of power sockets as well as a huge selection of drinks. I\'m a coffee lover and so getting the espresso, or Vietnamese iced coffee (Cà phê sữa đá Sài Gòn) is my choice. The prices vary from 20,000 - 35,000 VND. For smoothies or milk teas, you can expect to pay a bit more, about 40,000 - 60,000 VND. In some cafes, you can even order healthy food such as snacks or fresh fruits and vegetables. Expect to pay for a plate of fruits with cereals or omelet around 80,000 VND.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5490\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.home-office-danang.jpg\" alt=\"Home office in Da Nang\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> I usually work from home nowadays. It\'s very convenient and I always make sure to have enough coffee around me. There are countless cafe\'s around making delicious and strong Vietnamese coffee for up to 20,000 VND.</div>  Anyway, most of my time I\'m working at my apartment since I have a table and loads of street food vendors a few steps from my doorstep. The internet isn\'t the best, but mobile data serves as a great alternative. More on data packages later. <h2><strong>Visa Options</strong></h2> It\'s still relatively hassle-free to <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-tourist-visa\">get a tourist visa in Vietnam</a>, but is it the most convenient thing? I wouldn\'t say so. American citizens have the option to get a 1-year tourist visa, but still, they have to leave the country every three months. For other people who\'re on a tourist visa, you must leave the country every three months to do an infamous visa run. It\'s a pretty simple, but time and nerve-consuming process. There are a few visa run agents in the city that provide a full service. I really can\'t recommend <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/visatoliveinvietnam/\">Lynn Visa</a> more (I don\'t earn any commission, just genuinely love her passion and work). I\'ve already written about doing a <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/visa-run-vietnam\">visa run from Vietnam</a> in detail, so don\'t forget to read it.  There are also business visas available, but I\'ve heard some bad stories and I wouldn\'t recommend getting a business visa from the agency. If you\'re working as an <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/teach-english-vietnam\">English teacher</a> or in any other industry, you\'ll most likely get a work permit (harder these days) and temporary resident card which enables you to stay in Vietnam for 2 years. Getting married to a Vietnamese, investing or starting a business can land you a temporary resident card, but still, visa policies are very dynamic and changing all the time, so maybe the best option at the moment is a tourist visa. <h2><strong>Travel Insurance</strong></h2> For a long time, I haven\'t had any travel insurance and that was probably the most stupid thing you can do. I\'ve been a few times in a hospital (once doing CT and many checkings) and you don\'t want to look at hospital bills without the insurance. Get insurance! Currently, I\'m using my Croatian travel insurance that covers my health, transportation changes, and some technology for roughly $30/month. There are many travel insurance companies available, but I\'ve seen people recommending World Nomads. I\'ve never used it so I can\'t tell much about it.  There are a few international hospitals in Da Nang with English speaking staff and modern medical equipment. I\'ve been to Hoan My hospital a few times and every time they did an extremely professional job. <h2><strong>4G Internet</strong></h2> You can pick among a few competitive carriers in Vietnam and Vinaphone supposed to be the best one. I\'m using MobiFone and their (<em>C90N</em>) data plan with 120GB/month for 90,000 VND. Speeds are pretty good (not for uploading huge files or streaming) and the connection is stable which is everything I\'m looking for. The phone number with the data plan costs about 250,000 VND at the airport and 200,000 VND in official stores. Be sure to get your SIM card in the official store where they require your personal information since buying the SIM in local stores can lead to various problems.  Did you know that Vietnam enjoys one of the world\'s lowest mobile data costs? According to <a href=\"https://www.cable.co.uk/mobiles/worldwide-data-pricing/\">Cable.co.uk\'s research</a>, the average cost for 1GB of mobile data is just $0.06.  For instance, I\'ve bought a SIM in a local store without leaving any personal information and currently, I can call people, but no one can reach me out. The carrier explained to me it happens if you don\'t update your personal information regularly.  Also, the coverage of MobiFone is pretty good. I was driving on the bus from Da Nang to Saigon and during the whole trip, I didn\'t experience any major network problems. <h2><strong>Nightlife in Da Nang</strong></h2> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-5493\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.locals-on-the-beach.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnamese at the beach\" width=\"991\" height=\"741\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Locals slowly start to gather and prepare their snacks and beers after sunset on the beach.</div>  Da Nang is a very relaxed city featuring a different type of nightlife than in places like Phnom Penh or Bangkok. There is a <em>\'pub street\'</em> with dozens of pubs playing loud music on the banks of Han River. It\'s a pretty cool spot to drink with friends, play some pool and enjoy western music. Locals love to have Nhau which translates to <a href=\"https://e.vnexpress.net/news/travel-life/eating-and-drinking-for-no-particular-purpose-3491077.html\">drinking and eating without any certain reason</a>. There are countless of Nhau restaurants around An Thuong and beachside area where you can enjoy delicious Vietnamese food with a glass of beer always full. I really enjoy walking around My Khe beach during the night that completely changes its vibe.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5487\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.family-party.jpg\" alt=\"Family party in Da Nang\" width=\"1024\" height=\"541\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Getting invited by the local family party was priceless. We were singing Croatian songs while they were singing Vietnamese songs. It was an amazing and drunk time! :)</div>  If you\'re looking for a relaxed atmosphere and live music, I can\'t recommend An Thuong area more. There are a few places with cheap beers, a vibrant bunch of people, live music and thematic events. I suggest checking Crazy Cat\'s or Heaven bar (literally next to each other). A bottle of domestic beer costs around 20,000 VND in the bars around Da Nang.  Are you looking for a rooftop bar? I recommend Alacarte or Novotel for stunning views, swimming pools, nice music and a good selection of drinks. The beer in Alacarte costs 80,000 VND, but they have a happy hour where you get two beers for the price of one (3 - 6 pm). <h2><strong>Weather </strong></h2> Da Nang officially has two seasons - dry and wet season. The dry season starts from February and ends around September while the wet season takes place from October all the way to January. You can check a detailed post about the <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/best-time-to-visit-da-nang\">best time to visit Da Nang</a> to get a better understanding of the weather and seasons in Da Nang.  <img class=\"size-full wp-image-5489\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.high-season-danang.jpg\" alt=\"high season in Da Nang\" width=\"986\" height=\"735\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> My Khe beach is completely packed during the peak season. I recommend going to the northern beach near Son Tra to avoid crowds.</div>  Usually, tourists start to flock in from April till the end of August. I would say that April and May are the best months for enjoying the beach. From September you can expect changes in weather with more frequent showers. October and November are the months with the most rainfall and it\'s usual to experience a few storms and flooding during that period. Also, the temperature lowers down to 15°C.  Also, it\'s important to mention that some landlords tend to raise the accommodation prices during the dry season, so be sure to communicate everything in front and put everything in the contract.  <hr />  I hope this article answers some of your questions related to the costs of living in Da Nang.

He has been volunteering on different projects and traveling around the country with the motorbike for the last 9 months and he’s going to share bits of the knowledge with you when it comes to volunteering in Vietnam. So, you’ve decided to volunteer in Vietnam? That’s awesome, but depending on your current country, it’s not a small step since you need to be ready for many sacrifices and a complete change in your lifestyle. Once you’ve got the idea of volunteering in a foreign country, don’t immediately rush to it, but let it stay for a while. Think about it and do the research constantly. If the idea still stays with you after a few months, then volunteering is probably a thing you should do. In this article, I’m going to write about the things you should know before deciding to volunteer in Vietnam. <b>Note: </b>Regulations and laws are constantly changing in Vietnam, so always be sure that you checked everything with your embassy before going to Vietnam. The last thing you want is to be deported from the country where you just wanted to help local community. Believe me, it can happen and it happened to many people before!\n\n<b>Questions to Ask Yourself Before Volunteering in Vietnam</b> Alright, so you started to think about volunteering in Vietnam, that’s great, but there are many questions that come to your mind probably. If that’s the case, then you’re in a good position since all of that is totally natural. <em>What are the reasons and motivations behind volunteering in Vietnam?</em> First of all, why do you want to travel to Vietnam and volunteer there? Is it a short-term to cut your traveling expenses or you really care about the community and believe you can help them with your skills? Think about it as if you go to Vietnam to volunteer without a purpose, you won’t feel satisfied and your time won’t help much. 2) What about logistics and costs of documentation and program. Please note that almost every program is free and some projects even pay a stipend for volunteers, so don’t pay extra for the program. What about your visa process? Does your volunteering organization support you in visa process and what kind of visa they provide?   3) Which organization you want to be a host of the project you’d like to work on. It’s a crucial question since there are so many organizations that are working just for the sake of money and you will basically help to bring more profits to these organizations. Be sure that you’re collaborating with NGOs who have every information transparent and who’re not putting the profits in their pockets, but really putting the money in the communities.   4) What kind of project you’d like to work on? The majority of projects in Vietnam is about English teaching, but there are many other projects. Be careful with English teaching projects since many project claim they help the poor and underdeveloped communities, but once you come you realize that you’re doing nothing else then putting the money inside the pockets of owners and helping privileged people, while poor still don’t have the access to English lessons. Choose carefully your project and be sure there are many reviews so you can connect with the people who were already working on the project.   5) How long do you plan to volunteer on the project in Vietnam? Well, if you’re planning to work with the kids as an English teacher, it’s important that you stay for longer periods, ideally 6 - 12 months since kids need to form the connection with teachers so they can get the most of the lessons. Also, you can do more harm than good if you’re working with the kids only for a short term.   6) Are your skills really necessary and are you taking the job opportunity from local people by working on a volunteering project? I really advise you to work on the project where your skills can make the difference since working on the other projects can take the job opportunity to a local person! That can do more harm than good!   7) How much money do you need for your stay and will you be able to budget your money correctly? What perks do you get from the organization in exchange for your time?   8) Does the organization offer the contract? Please be careful when reading the contract and always ask as many questions as possible!   Once you have the answers to these questions, I think you’re more than prepared to go over to Vietnam and start making a change.   I literally did an interview with the head of an organization, bought a one-way ticket and fly without any plan and just $200 in my pocket. There were tough times because I didn’t plan anything, but still, it teaches you how to be flexible and it’s not the hardest thing ever in Vietnam!   Don’t be like me and plan things accordingly!   <b>Where to Find a Volunteering Project That Really Makes a Difference?</b>   Once you’ve got all the answers for the questions above and you’ve decided to go to Vietnam to volunteer, it’s important that you find a suitable project for you.   Today, there are many places and platforms filled with volunteering projects, and it’s sometimes very tricky to know which platform or project is reliable. In this section, I will try to give you the guide on finding a reliable project that will really do the lasting impact on the local community.   Please note that I’m not a person with much experience! I’ve been volunteering only in Vietnam on different project related to English teaching and I’ve been using few platforms to find the projects. There are many other opportunities and ways to find a suitable project!   So, I advise you to check out three platforms (not an affiliate nor earning any money from the platforms. These I personally used and believe they are the most accurate):\n<ul>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Workaway which can be found at workaway.info</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helpstay which can be found at helpstay.com</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use different facebook groups for the fastest and most reliable communication with the hosts</li>\n</ul>\nI found my first project on the HelpStay platform when I was mindlessly scrolling around the platform and checking the projects in Vietnam. For the platform, you need to create an account which costs you $30 per year, but you can use the platform without the account. The account gives you the opportunity to outreach hosts and talk to them through the platform. I wrote a comprehensive review on HelpStay, so if you’d like to learn more about the platform, feel free to check it out.   I never subscribed to any platform not because I don’t support the platforms, but because I was totally broke at the time when I was looking for the project and $30 was a lot of money to me that time. The way I did was getting the information on the platform about the organization or host and then doing the further research on Google or Social media about the organizations. Usually, you will find the project and contact information in few minutes which is enough to get in contact with the right person.   The same goes with workaway! I don’t personally use workaway that much, but I’ve met hundreds of people who mainly use workaway for finding their next volunteering project.   I gave a try to workaway when I was traveling around Vietnam with a motorbike since I realized that majority of projects there are kind of short-term and people are using the platform to find a voluntourism opportunity. It works as a charm! It also has a subscription program where you need to get an account, but I’ve never got one. I just used the same strategy as I used for HelpStay.   Also, I wrote a huge review of Workaway, so if you’d like to know more about the platform, feel free to check it out.   In my perspective, Facebook groups are the best and fastest way to find your new volunteering project. The reason for it is that it’s free which means many people are using the platform and it’s transparent since the people posting the projects have the personal accounts they are using on a daily basis.   I suggest you to try these groups: - - - - -   Connect with hosts through Facebook, check their private profiles and organization profiles (website and social media). The best would be if you can get the information on previous or current volunteers so you can connect with them and talk about their experiences. That’s the thing you always want to do - talk with people who were working on the project!   Many organizations will post their projects and tell many good things while supporting a false marketing, but once you come there you will see how different the situation is! To avoid it, just talk with people who have the experience with the organization.   These are three ways I’ve been using when finding a volunteering project in Vietnam (or globally), but there are still other ways how to find a reliable project.   Probably there are crazy good ways to find the best project out there, and if you know it, don’t hesitate to share it with us!   <b>What to Expect From Volunteering in Vietnam?</b>   While volunteering in Vietnam, there are things you should expect to get in return for the time you invest.   The only thing you invest while you’re working on the project should be a time, but on many projects you will also need to invest your money. Also, don’t forget the time, energy and money you invested before coming to Vietnam! You should take all into the account when planning a new volunteering project.   So, when checking the volunteering opportunities in Vietnam, almost every project, which is connected to English teaching, will at least provide you with housing and some meals. Some projects even provide you with a stipend as they support foreigners to travel around Vietnam to experience the country after they finish the projects.   I was working on English teaching project in countryside where I’ve got everything covered; food, accommodation and transportation. It was a very cool experience, and here you can read about it in details.   I literally didn’t need to spend any money there, but in reality, I was spending around $80 per month, mainly on coffee and luxury meals. I was once broke without any money with me and I was living without a penny for 3 weeks. It was manageable, but not the biggest pleasure of my life.   Plan your budget accordingly depending on the place you’re planning to stay, so you avoid the situation when you run out of the money in a foreign country.   Probably you hear this a lot, but, don’t be like Antonio!   The second project I was working at was at cool English speaking cafe in Da Nang city. I stayed there for almost three months and had one of the best experiences of my life. I’ve met amazing people and had some of the best conversations with local people of my life. Also, I’ve learned so much about Vietnam staying at that place. They were offering a dorm room shared with 8 people, but without the meals. It was a fair deal since the food in Da Nang is quite cheap and you only work 4 times per week. It means a lot of free time to explore or work on the side, but you need to seriously plan your budget if you want to do it!   I was talking with some organizations and people who were volunteering for the organizations that claim they provide with stipend, usually $200 monthly, for their volunteers to cover the costs for traveling. Usually, the food and accommodation is paid by the host, but the real question comes when the money is involved.   How reliable it is?   Some people were lucky and they’ve got their money, while many people said there were lot of problems and time spent until they’ve got a portion or whole amount agreed. I personally wouldn’t put my cards on these stipends!   Always ask for a monthly pays and if they start to talk something different than agreed, just find another project!   Also, there are some NGO projects in remote areas that really make change on local community, but during the lack of funds, they ask volunteers for a small daily payments to support themselves.   <b>Actionable Steps to Find Your Next Volunteering Project in Vietnam!</b>   Enough information, let’s get to the real thing! Let’s get your first volunteering project in Vietnam.   Here are actionable steps that will help you in finding a meaningful project in Vietnam:\n<ol>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First things first, think about your reasons and motivation to go to Vietnam at first place. What kind of specific skills do you have and can you devote enough time to really make a difference?</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Register to Workaway or Helpstay or simply just use the platforms to scrape the information. If you don’t want to use any platforms, then Facebook groups will work more than fine. We shared many groups that will help you connect with amazing hosts and projects that make difference to local communities around the country.</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find a reliable project that has a transparent profile and positive reviews from other volunteers. Connect with the head of organization and talk about details of project. Also, don’t forget to connect with previous volunteers as these people will most-likely give you the genuine opinion based on their experience.</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do the interview with the organization and confirm the documentation needed for you to legally volunteer for them. Legit volunteer organizations always sponsor their volunteers with the right visa which is usually a business visa. Vietnam always changes the policies when it comes to foreigners volunteering or working in Vietnam, so the safest would be to have a business visa. Check out what the organization offer you in return for the energy and time you invest into the project.</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you’re happy with the details and confident you’re going to volunteer for a certain project, it’s time to plan your budget depending on the perks of the project. Plan your budget carefully since you don’t want to run out of the money in Vietnam.</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buy a plane ticket and get ready for your next adventure!</li>\n</ol>\nThat’s it! Everything in 6 steps!   It’s not looking like a complicated process, but believe me you will probably spend at least a month just thinking and planning this adventure. There are so many opportunities and options which makes it very hard and tricky to pick the right one.   Don’t worry if you think it takes you much time, you’re not the only one!   Just relax, take your time and plan accordingly.   Wish you all the luck in your next adventure in Vietnam. Once you’re here, don’t forget to send us a message so we can connect and help each other!   Also, if you need a help while looking for a reliable project, I really advise to check out my experience volunteering as an English teacher in rural Vietnam. I can share with you the information and connect you with the right people who can help you to come and work on the same project.   Cheers!', 'All You Need to Know About Volunteering in Vietnam', 'TODO: Write Excerpt\r\n', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'all-you-need-to-know-about-volunteering-in-vietnam', '', '', '2020-04-23 19:18:29', '2020-04-23 19:18:29', '', 0, 'http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/?p=12749', 0, 'post', '', 0),
(12750, 2, '2019-11-30 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'On the Ha Giang loop, you will come in touch with many ethnic minority groups, as the Ha Giang Province is predominantly populated by such groups.  Travelers on the Ha Giang loop have an unique opportunity to see the daily lives of the Northern Vietnamese people. As you ride through their villages, you will see them wearing their fascinating and colorful traditional garments.  In most of their communities, you will see how each person in the community has a role to play. You will see women carrying their baskets in colorful clothes, children playing around and helping out their parents with their work and men hard at work with building new structures for the community.  Seeing these people working hard every day as a close-knit community and still managing to keep their smiles wide is incredibly astonishing. Especially for someone coming from the more individualistic, Western culture.  <em>Now, here is an overview of some of the most known ethnic groups in Ha Giang.</em> <h2><strong>Hmong People</strong></h2> The Hmong are the largest ethnic group out of 17 more in the Dong Van Karst Plateau Geo Park area. They migrated from China to Northern Vietnam 300 years ago. Now, the Hmong are mainly populating mountainous provinces such as Ha Giang.  Actually, the Hmong make up 32% of the total population of the Ha Giang province. They can be divided into two subgroups: <strong>White Hmong </strong>and <strong>Flower Hmong</strong>.  The Hmong are renowned for their traditional milpa - a type of a crop-growing system. In such a system, they plant rice, maize and other crops together.  They also produce handicrafts and are highly skilled in making wooden furniture, casting, forging, knitting and weaving.  How does a traditional Hmong house look like? It is mainly made from earth and is divided into three compartments. The middle compartment of the Hmong house is reserved as the altar for their ancestor cult.  You can recognize the Hmong women wearing unique traditional clothing. Their clothing style consists of a skirt, blouse, shirt, belt, leggings and a turban that is knitted around the head. Also, their dresses usually have decorative patterns such as butterflies, snakes, flowers, bird eyes and more to make them stand out.  The traditional customs, ceremonies, habits, and rituals are quite numerous in the Hmong groups. Each family has a different way of worshipping their ancestors. They also worship numerous spirits, some of them being the Door Ghost and the Great Mother Ghost, which are related to their ancestor worship and hospitality to the guests.  The Hmong literature and art show their psychological profile as a community. They have a lot of lovely traditional songs about love that they play using flute, pan-pipe, and leaf-horn. <h2><strong>Dao People</strong></h2> The Dao people can be divided into several sub-groups: <ul>          <li>Red Dao</li>          <li>Coin Dao</li>          <li>White Trousers Dao</li>          <li>Long Robe Dao</li>          <li>Lo River Dao</li> </ul> These people live off farming and they usually have their farms on mountain slopes where they make the rice terraces.  They possess unique handicraft skills such as casting, embroidery, forging, jewelry and wax-printing and dyeing clothes.  The Dao people live in stilt or earth houses, close to rivers and other water sources. You will usually see their houses made out of a combination of stilt and earth.  The Dao people can be spotted wearing dresses with traditional features and designs that are made from colored thread. They have lots of types of turbans, skirts, and shirts.  The Dao ethnic minority group follows a complex religion and culture. Their beliefs demonstrate communal spirit, conscience, and conception. Worship and wizardry isn\'t just a mere superstition to them. They look at these things as something special and that indicated the depth of their culture, no matter how hard it may be to understand for an outsider.  The Dao people have a rich folkloric literature that consists of numerous legends, myths, stories, and pop songs. All of that folklore implies their perception of how the universe and human life are communal, and that further establishes their communal spirit. <h2><strong>Tay People</strong></h2> This is the second-largest ethnic minority in the Ha Giang Province. The Tay people make up 25% of the total province population. They live off planting rice in wet fields near the rivers, mountain feet, and farming slopes.  The Tay build their villages at the mountain foot. The villages usually consist of 15 - 20 houses. Their houses are made of stilt while the roof is made of palm leaves or grass using the thatch method.  They have a developed family handicraft and are skilled in making wooden furniture, knitting and pottery. Their weaving craft is well-known around the region. They make blankets and brocade turbans, utilizing rich patterns that are adored by many people.  The Tay people can be recognized wearing cotton clothes that are indigo dyed with accessories such as silver necklaces and silver rings. Actually, the main color of their garments is indigo.  The Tay people have a very diversified culture. They have different kinds of ceremonies for food production, newborns, weddings and funerals. The Tay even celebrate the building of new houses!  They have rich folklore and literature too that consist of legends, myths, ancient stories, and folkloric songs. The Tay people practice Then religion. The main characteristics of this religion are ancestor worship and the worship of the gods of the natural environment. <h2><strong>Nung People</strong></h2> The Nung ethnic minority group can be mainly found in the Quan Ba district. They live in valleys located near the rivers, streams, and hills. These people live off farming rice and they utilize a high cultivation technique with rice terraces on mountain slopes. They also live off highly developed animal raising.  As with other ethnic minorities in Ha Giang, the Nung people possess handicraft skills that are very diverse. That included casting, carpentering, forging, knitting, and very diverse cloth weaving techniques.  Their clothing is mainly indigo colored. You can spot Nung women wearing robes of five panels with buttons under the right armpit. The Nung men wear shirts with an upright collar that leaves their breasts and bellies open.  They live in stilt houses that have two compartments. The outer compartment is reserved for men and ancestor worship, while the inner compartment is reserved for women. This indicates the roles of the genders in the Nung community.  The Nung people don\'t celebrate death anniversaries. They have colorful birthday celebrations and worship the dead on the 15th of July of the lunar calendar every year.  One tradition that stands out in the Nung community is the wedding ceremony. This ceremony preserves numerous ancient customs that the Nung stay true to. The brother of the bridegroom\'s mother plays an important role in this tradition. He represents the bridegroom family in the marriage proposal and organizes all the ceremonies that are related to the wedding.  Nung people also have rich folklore. Their folklore is famous for <em>Sli</em>, a love dialogue song of young people. <h2><strong>Giay People</strong></h2> The Giay ethnic minority group lives off rice and the milpa cultivation system. They organize the <em>Rong Pooc</em> ceremony every year to begin their farming season. The Giay build pig pens and hen coops in their fields, far from their houses.  These people are noteworthy for their handicrafts. They are highly skilled in bamboo knitting and weaving.  You can spot them wearing simple dresses, with no noteworthy design. The men wear a shirt with wide sleeves that is opened at the right armpit and wide trousers that are shortened to knee length. You can see women wearing a dress that consists of a robe that covers the buttock. This dress has broad sleeves and is opened at the right armpit. They also tend to put a different colored piece of clothing on the sleeves to stand out.  The Giay people live in stilt houses of 3 compartments. Middle compartment of the house is reserved for ancestor worship. The altar in the middle compartment has three bowls that are reserved for the Land God, the Kitchen God, and the ancestors.  They have interesting marriage customs too! When the youngsters attain a mature age for marriage, they don\'t choose their brides. Instead, their horoscope signs are taken into the notion and they are paired with suitable horoscope signs.  The Giay people also have rich folklore that consists of many poems, proverbs, and phrases. <h2><strong>Lo Lo People</strong></h2> We can divide the Lo Lo people into two sub-groups: <strong>Flower Lo Lo </strong>and <strong>Black Lo Lo</strong>. They have lived in Lung Cu area since the ancient times and they have made many efforts for their land to remain untouched.  The Lo Lo people have a very rich and unique folklore and culture that is preserved in their dances, songs, and legends.  Their turbans, shirts, skirts, and trousers are decorated with lots of colors.  The Lo Lo calendar divides a year in 11 months. Each month corresponds to an animal name, similar to the lunar calendar.  This ethnic minority group is notable for the ancient bronze drums, which are holy for them. The bronze drums are buried with the dead for protection and are occasionally dug out for use. These drums are kept by the head of each Lo Lo family. They are only used during funerals or festivals, the main reason is to maintain the rhythm for the dances.  Actually, the Lo Lo people are one of the few Vietnamese ethnic groups that still use bronze drums. Interestingly, we can connect this traditional instrument to the legend of <em>the Flood</em>. The legend tells a story of a climactic flood that raised the water levels up to the sky, drawing parallels to many other mythologies.  So, the bronze drums come into play in this legend in a scene where the God saves a girl and her younger brother by placing the girl in a big bronze drum and the boy in a small bronze drum. They survived on the mountains after the flood, and became a couple, essentially becoming a symbol for a rebirth of humankind.  This legend impacts the Lo Lo perception of Yin and Yang symbols and the concept of birth. The mentioned perception is still preserved in how the Lo Lo people play the bronze drums - the male and female drums are played at the same time.  The Lo Lo people have a very specific burial ritual. They hang the bronze drums on a stand that is located at the feet of the dead and the drums must face each other. The drummer stands between the drums and alternates between each drum with only one end of the drumstick. They believe that the souls of the dead can only find their way back to ancestors with the sound of bronze drums. <h2><strong>Pu Peo People</strong></h2> The Pu Peo people exclusively populate the Ha Giang province. In fact, there are only 705 people of this ethnic minority group living in Dong Van, Meo Vac and Bac Me areas (at least according to the data from 1999). With such a low population, the Pu Peo ranks 53rd of 54 in the Vietnamese community in terms of population.  The first record of the Pu Peo group can be accounted to <em>Kien Van Tieu Luc</em>, a book written in the middle of the 18th century. They are also mentioned in early 19th century documents under the names of <em>Penti</em>, <em>Pentilolo</em>, <em>Kaobeo</em>, and finally, <em>Pu Peo</em>.  The Pu Peo people live scattered in the mountain areas along the Chinese border. They differ from the Hmong people because they build their villages of flat ground in mountain areas. The Pu Peo people are usually found in Pho La, Sung Trang, and Phu Lung. These places are connected by the sub-tropical climate that is essential to the Pu Peo for growing rice and using the forests to earn for their living.  The Pu Peo people believe that the success and failure of each family and individual is directly connected to the position of their land and house. Because of that belief, they have a deeply religious house building process.  They follow strict religious procedures that are integrated into the selection of the land, selection the trees for pillars and selection of the building itself with the climax of the relocating ceremony. Interestingly, Pu Peo believe that all of these procedures must be fulfilled before dawn for good luck.  <em>They also worship their ancestors. More specifically, they worship three ancestor generations:</em> <ul>          <li>Parents (<em>Pe</em>)</li>          <li>Grandparents <em>(Te Ngan)</em></li>          <li>Great grandparents <em>(Te Gao)</em></li> </ul> For each of these three generations, the Pu Peo will put a jar (<em>loog ten</em>) on the altar inside the house. Offerings are made to ancestors on the first day in the new house and are put in these jars. In each jar, they put a chicken, a few small balls of cooked rice and more meat. They also believe that these offerings must be completed until dawn. After the ceremony and the offerings are done, the relatives and neighbors will come with a chicken, a bottle of wine and some money to wish good luck for their hosts.  The Pu Peo people use the Zhou dynasty calendar. This calendar consists of cycles or <em>khuop mai</em>, Each cycle equals 12 years. The year consists of 12 months, 29 or 30 days make a month and 12 hours will make a single day. This calendar is similar to the usual Vietnamese lunar calendar in a way that there is a leap year every three years.

I\'ve never met a person who didn\'t mention Vietnamese food while sharing the experiences from Vietnam which was more than enough for me to deeply explore a diversity of Vietnamese cuisine. As Da Nang is my home, I was blessed enough with the opportunity to drive around local places and markets and try a huge variety of street food.  I must be honest, some food was amazing, while some not so much (Trung Vit Lon I\'m talking about you!), but what always impresses me is the number of choices. Literally, everyone will find their favorite bowl or salad, no matter how picky you are.  After almost a year of living in Da Nang, my girlfriend and I decided to make a list of local specialties and drive around the city in order to try different delicacies. Our list consists of more than 35 local dishes, but for now, we only had a chance to taste 16. As I\'m currently not in Vietnam, you can expect the updates a bit later.  Anyway, keep reading as we\'re going to write about our favorite Da Nang street food &amp; where to find the best portion in the city.  <strong>#1- Mi Quang</strong>  Alright, probably there is not a single person who hasn\'t stumbled upon Mi Quang restaurant or tried one bowl of this iconic central Vietnamese dish. As you travel around Vietnam, you\'ll notice the food slightly changes, and Mi Quang in Da Nang is the same as Pho in Hanoi. Originating from Quang Nam province (Da Nang is a former capital), Mi Quang comes in different varieties following traditional recipes. Locals enjoy this tasty dish for breakfast or lunch, but it\'s not odd to see Mi Quang served on death anniversaries or even Tet holiday.  An iconic bowl of Mi Quang has many ingredients that combined give a mouthwatering taste. Wide cooked rice noodles served with just a pinch of delicious broth and a combination of fresh herbs and spices. You can find many versions of this dish as locals love to experiment with shrimps, chicken, fish or beef. You\'ll get a small basket filled with fresh herbs such as basil, cilantro, onion leaves, mint and lettuce to spice it up. I really love to add a bit of chili powder, a few drops of lime juice and a bit of fish sauce for extra taste.  Since I was living in An Thuong area, I\'ve found a tiny restaurant that was always full for a lunchtime. They were serving Mi Quang exclusively and it\'s easy to get hooked. Alternatively, we enjoyed a bowl of this dish at the Han market or Thanh Khe district. I\'ll leave down the address and details, so you can enjoy a delicious bowl yourself! :)  #2- Pho Bo/Ga  An iconic Pho is a Vietnamese traditional dish that got so popular around the world. In Da Nang, Pho isn\'t such a thing (it\'s a dish from the north), but you can still find it in many places. I personally find Pho in Da Nang very delicious, but not something I\'d eat more than once in a week. On the other hand, Hanoi\'s Pho is definitely something I\'m eating every day. Like people always say about the soups - the broth is everything, so I guess Hanoians know their broth.  Probably everyone knows about Pho, so I don\'t want to go too deep about the ingredients and way of cooking. There are many versions of Pho, but the most common is with beef or chicken. A traditional Vietnamese soup has a delicious broth mixed with meat, fresh vegetables and herbs, and rice noodles. As I\'m really enjoying reading about Vietnamese history, the interesting fact about Pho becoming so popular around the world is that refugees from the world introduced this dish all around the world.  You can eat Pho around Da Nang in many places, and for me, it was kinda hard to find a Pho that can compare with Hanoi\'s version. Since my girlfriend knows good restaurants, we ended up on the other side of the Han river, sitting in a huge restaurant flocked by Korean tourists. She was swearing it\'s the best Pho in Da Nang. I liked it, but for me, it\'s simply not the food I prefer eating in Da Nang.

If you\'re short on time, but still looking to explore the hidden corners of Hanoi that\'ll introduce you to Vietnamese culture and traditions as well as rough history, then our 2 days in Hanoi itinerary is definitely for you. <h2>2 Days in Hanoi Itinerary - Explore a Vibrant Vietnamese Culture</h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5633\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.hanoi-people.jpg\" alt=\"Explore Vietnamese culture\" width=\"780\" height=\"580\" />  Hanoi, the authentic and traditional capital of Vietnam, is one of the most visited places in Vietnam, and for a good reason! Sometimes, it feels like a massive village, as lots of former traditional villages converged to form a larger whole. Alongside the local influence, there is a heavy French colonial vibe in the architecture and some of the cuisine.  For all you people who are visiting Hanoi either to kick off your road trip, experience the diverse street food options, or just opting to embrace the authentic atmosphere; it is very challenging to create an itinerary for just 2 days in Hanoi. Hanoi is a huge city, with a <strong>population count of almost 8 million people and an area of 319.56 square kilometers</strong>!  So, this itinerary is a combination of our personal experience in Hanoi and some places that we missed, but you definitely shouldn’t! Also, if you want a tailored Hanoi itinerary, we can help you create the one that suits your budget and preferences! <div data-gyg-href=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/default/activites.frame\" data-gyg-locale-code=\"en-US\" data-gyg-widget=\"activities\" data-gyg-number-of-items=\"3\" data-gyg-partner-id=\"781AB6P\" data-gyg-q=\"hanoi tour\"></div> <script async defer src=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js\"></script> <h2>Day 1 - Strolling Around the Old Quarter</h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5639\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.cong-caphe.jpg\" alt=\"Walking around the Old Quarter\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" />  We hope that you are an early riser, as you are just spending 2 days in Hanoi, so why not maximize these two days? For breakfast, we suggest visiting the Old Quarter first. It is just beside all the major attractions that we will include in this itinerary.  Don’t be intimidated by the chaotic traffic flowing through the Quarter since you will get used to it very quickly. As you wander around in the morning, you will find numerous local restaurants around. You can spot a local restaurant by the tiny plastic stools and tables. They are also filled with locals who\'re kickstarting their day with a bowl of tasty Phở soup. A bowl of Phở will cost you anywhere <strong>between 20,000 to 40,000 VND ($0,87 to $1,73)</strong>.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5635\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.vietnamese-coffee.jpg\" alt=\"Enjoy a tasty Vietnamese coffee\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" />  After you finish your breakfast, we suggest a supercharging with a glass of cà phê sữa đá (<a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide\">Vietnamese iced coffee</a>). The sweet caffeine bomb will set you from <strong>10,000 to 30,000 VND ($0,43 – $1,23)</strong>. If you like your coffee unique, why not try the popular Cà phê trứng (Egg coffee)? It will probably cost you some 10,000 to 20,000 VND more than the usual iced coffee, but it is well worth it! Arguably the best place for this traditional beverage is <a href=\"http://cafegiang.vn/\">Cafe Giang</a>, so don\'t forget to check it out.  <strong>Further Read: </strong><a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-coffee-culture\">Vietnamese coffee culture: A Brief History &amp; Coffee Types</a>  Just a few minutes away from the Old Quarter is Hoan Kiem Lake. It is a dash of relaxation in the otherwise hectic Hanoi center. The lake is like a tranquil oasis just in the middle of the city that serves as a socializing spot for friendly locals who\'ll often invite you for a talk or dance. In the middle of the lake, you can see the magnificent, crumbling Turtle Tower from the <a href=\"http://en.hanoi.vietnamplus.vn/Home/The-legend-of-Hoan-Kiem-Lake/20099/220.vnplus\">legend of the Hoan Kiem Lake</a>.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5634\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.hoan-kiem-lake.jpg\" alt=\"Hoan Kiem Lake\" width=\"781\" height=\"585\" />  After a dose of relaxation at the Hoan Kiem Lake, we suggest that you visit Ngoc Son Temple. The temple is located on the lake, and you can easily distinguish it by the bright red bridge called Huc Bridge. It is a tranquil place that opens from 8 AM to 6 PM, and the <strong>entrance fee is 30,000 VND ($1,30)</strong>.  Just a few minutes away from the Hoan Kiem Lake is the St. Joseph Cathedral serves as a fantastic showcase of Gothic architecture. The exterior of the cathedral showcases the French architectural influence so prevalent in this side of the city. There is no entrance fee for the cathedral, so you are free to enter and enjoy the magnificent interior. It features huge arch pillars and colorful Christian motifs. Make sure to wear long sleeves inside the cathedral.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5636\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.hanoi-cathedral.jpg\" alt=\"St. Joseph Catherdral in Hanoi\" width=\"783\" height=\"583\" />  You are probably craving for a snack now! Luckily, there are numerous <span lang=\"vi\" title=\"Vietnamese language text\">bánh mì</span> stalls in this neighborhood. It is a French baguette sandwich usually filled with freshly picked vegetables herbs and meat or eggs. The average price on the street is <strong>from 15,000 VND to 30,000 VND ($0,65 to $1,08)</strong>.  For a dose of education on the recent history of Vietnam, we suggest visiting the Hoa Lo Prison. It is just a 10-minute walk from St. Joseph Cathedral. Also known as the <em>Hanoi Hilton</em>, most of the prison has been destroyed for skyscraper construction. The remains of the structure now serve as a museum. It was built by the French during the colonial period and mainly used as a prison for Vietnamese revolutionaries or anyone connected to them.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5637\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.prison-2.jpg\" alt=\"Hoa Lo Prison\" width=\"772\" height=\"577\" />  During the war in Vietnam, this place was also used to imprison the American POWs, hence the Hilton name. Prepare for some unsettling imagery as this museum details the hardships of Vietnamese people during the French colonial period. We don\'t want to spoil you any more details, but you will leave with some exciting insights on how different was the treatment of prisoners during the two administrative periods. Hoa Lo prison is open from 8 AM to 5 PM, and the <strong>entrance fee is 30,000 VND ($1,30)</strong>.  By now, you will want to tone down a bit on the sightseeing and enjoy the early evening hours. You should head back to the Old Quarter, which is now starting to buzz with life. Locals are gathering for dinner, and are slowly starting with their beer binge! There are numerous street food options to find around here, from rice noodles with meatballs (bun cha) to rice flour pancakes (bánh cuốn). To get some ideas on what to eat, don\'t forget to check out our <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-street-food\">Vietnamese street food guide</a>!  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5638\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.bia-hoi.jpg\" alt=\"Bia Hoi in Hanoi\" width=\"843\" height=\"556\" />  Probably the best way to end your first day in Hanoi is to indulge in the local drinking culture. By that, we mean - the beer. Beer in Vietnam is incredibly cheap, with prices<strong> starting from 5,000 VND (0,22 cents) for a 0,3 liter can of beer</strong>. There are numerous local bars around the Old Quarter which will be filled with locals who will enjoy sharing a drink with you. Hanoi is also famous for one of the cheapest beers in the world - <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/bia-hoi-vietnam\">Bia Hoi</a>. It is dirt-cheap, and you can get hammered for a few dollars.  <strong>Day 1 Summary:</strong> <ul>          <li>Start the day with a bowl of Phở and a glass of coffee in the Old Quarter</li>          <li>Take a stroll and relax at Hoan Kiem Lake</li>          <li>Visit the tranquil Ngoc Son Temple</li>          <li>Marvel at the magnificent Gothic architecture of the St. Joseph Cathedral</li>          <li>Grab a <span lang=\"vi\" title=\"Vietnamese language text\">bánh mì</span> to regain your energy</li>          <li>Get some education at the Hoa Lo Prison</li>          <li>Enjoy the evening with some tasty street food and ice-cold beer</li> </ul> <h2>Day 2 - Further Sightseeing of Hanoi</h2> We hope that you didn\'t wake up hungover from the last night, as the final part of our 2 days in Hanoi itinerary is taking place today!  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5641\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.street-food-hanoi.jpg\" alt=\"Walking around Hanoi streets\" width=\"782\" height=\"583\" />  To get back in motion, we suggest that you start your morning with a visit to the Dong Xuan Market. It is the busiest traditional market that you can find in the heart of Hanoi\'s Old Quarter. The opening time of the market is at 8 AM, and it closes at 6 PM. It is a very crowded market and is a great entry point to experience the chaotic market experience of Hanoi. To get some breakfast, get to the northern side of the market where you can snatch some cheap breakfast, freshly squeezed juice and buzz up with coffee. There is also a lot more to see here, from souvenir shops to clothing shops.  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> <strong> Note:</strong> Make sure to haggle in this market and any other Vietnamese market! The most effective strategy is to cut the asking prices by 70% and start the negotiation process from there. Make sure to learn a few Vietnamese phrases, as this will induce a bit of respect from the locals. Maybe that\'s what you need for a decent bargain!</div>  As the first day of the itinerary was filled with a healthy balance of sightseeing and indulging the culture, we will continue this flow onwards.  Either take a 25-minute walk or take a Grab to the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum. It is one of the most popular attractions in Hanoi, as it is a final resting place in Ho Chi Minh. Interestingly, he never wanted his body to be embalmed, but rather wished his ashes to be spread after his death. The authorities built this magnificent structure instead, to honor him. It is one of the most guarded places in Hanoi, so you should definitely obey the rules. Also, the line for the inner sanctum can get ridiculously long. Nevertheless, getting inside the mausoleum and seeing the embalmed body of Ho Chi Minh is definitely one of the highlights of Hanoi sightseeing tour.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5642\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.ho-chi-minh-mausoleum.jpg\" alt=\"Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum\" width=\"840\" height=\"556\" />  After the mausoleum, make sure to visit the Ho Chi Minh Museum. The <strong>entrance fee is 40,000 VND ($1,73)</strong>. This museum is distinguishable by its white lotus symbol, which symbolizes the homeland of Ho Chi Minh. It is divided into several sections. The first section details the personal life of Ho Chi Minh, and how he became an influential revolutionary he is known for today. Another section shows the details of the war, and how the Vietnamese people emerged victorious from it. The last section shows some important historical events that had a severe impact on Ho Chi Minh\'s ideals. It is an ideal place to learn about Ho Chi Minh and his contribution to Vietnamese history.  <img class=\"wp-image-5644 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e10ce3e155fc.jpg\" alt=\"One Pillar Pagoda in Hanoi\" width=\"709\" height=\"469\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> By <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/deepgoswami/5739930561/in/photolist-9KdDo2-Nmb4z7-Q3o6Wz-PpharK-6ewLBJ-boNA48-boNANF-boNBuT-aCpkY-QPj5nq-6kqwm1-6mVLdw-6mVME5-6mREDF-6gWtmh-2VNA8z-agurt9-ZMQu-eN977e-8jKQXr-2VTrL5-agurnG-9DHZv5-8RRtGi-aojaVr-7W9TM3-9JRRNZ-9Kd2k4-NG5ZmR-9Kd3uz-8Kmdbx-PGCdiS-2WdDCE-4Jj8g8-4JjaJp-9Kd4gR-fRTdzh-8KpgAQ-4JonME-dNbZUV-PmJoX3-95ZFDE-fRTDsb-dNbZE4-dNhxE3-dNbYLa-dNhyEU-bwBEgQ-dt11N-7Wady7\">Deep Goswami</a> - One Pillar Pagoda, Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 2.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)</div>  Before you leave this complex, you should definitely check out the One Pillar Pagoda, which is one of the unique architectural accomplishments in Asia. The entrance to the pagoda is free, and it is open from 8 AM to 11.30 AM during the morning, and from 2 PM to 4 PM during the afternoon. What makes this pagoda unique is that it is placed on a stone pillar, seemingly defying gravity. The exterior of the pagoda is magnificent, with beautiful lotus images in combination with wooden pillars. And the interior is equally as impressive, with the statue of Guan Yin Buddha dominating it. The whole area around the pagoda is very relaxing, so we recommend embracing the zen vibes beside the pond and the bodhi tree.  Now, it is probably that time of the day when you need to get a snack and fill up with some coffee! Go back to the Old Quarter and find some new amazing street food place, as there is always something new on the corner!  After you regain your energy, we suggest a short walk to the National Museum of History. The <strong>entrance fee is 30,000 VND ($1,30)</strong>. You can visit it during the morning hours from 8 AM to noon, and during the afternoon hours from 1.30 PM to 5 PM. There is a lot of history to learn about here, from the French invasion in Vietnam in the 19th century to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reunification_Day\">reunification of Vietnam in 1975.</a>  <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5650\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.ho-chi-minh-statue.jpg\" alt=\"The statue of Ho Chi Minh in the National Museum of History.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />  The museum details the formation of modern Vietnam and shows their struggle for independence. We think that it is essential to learn about the history of the country you are visiting, gaining more perspective and further respect its people. That\'s why we wholly recommend you to visit it.  <img class=\"wp-image-5645 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e10cf4cd042b.jpg\" alt=\"Thang Long Water Puppet Show\" width=\"709\" height=\"470\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> By <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirksiang/2126605685/in/photolist-4R7PDp-4ECPz5-4EsL1w-4Eyy3B-cXGZa-4eVpMg-9hTxrr-8p9X86-e38sDj-NG4ZPM-g4SuAV-g4SBU1\">Kirk Siang</a> - Water puppet show at Thang Long Theatre, Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 2.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)</div>  To end your final day in a traditional fashion, why not watch an evening show at the Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre? The opening time of the theatre is at 3 PM, 4.10 PM, 5.20 PM, 6.30 PM, and 8 PM. A one-hour performance consists of short stories that detail the life in ancient Vietnam. The puppet performance is backed by traditional tunes performed by a Vietnamese orchestra. This unique experience will cost you <strong>100,000 VND ($4,33)</strong>. We advise that you book it in advance because this is one of the most popular attractions in Hanoi. <div data-gyg-href=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/default/activites.frame\" data-gyg-locale-code=\"en-US\" data-gyg-widget=\"activities\" data-gyg-number-of-items=\"3\" data-gyg-partner-id=\"781AB6P\" data-gyg-q=\"thang long\"></div> <script async defer src=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js\"></script>  <strong>Day 2 Summary:</strong> <ul>          <li>Visit the busy Dong Xuan Market</li>          <li>Observe the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum</li>          <li>Get educated in the Ho Chi Minh Museum</li>          <li>Marvel at the beauty of One Pillar Pagoda</li>          <li>Get some tasty street food snack in the Old Quarter</li>          <li>Learn about Vietnamese history in the National Historical Museum</li>          <li>Watch a unique puppet show at Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre</li> </ul> <h2>Getting To &amp; Around Hanoi</h2> Hanoi is the second-largest city in Vietnam and hosts more than 16 million tourists annually. It is only understandable that the tourism infrastructure is quite developed in Hanoi. Getting to Hanoi is quite convenient as there is the main national highway connection to the southern and northern provinces. You can get to Hanoi by international or domestic flight, bus, or train. <h3>Getting from the Noi Bai Airport to Hanoi Old Quarter</h3> <p id=\"CxTwfjc\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5646 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e10cfffd42ed.jpg\" alt=\"Thang Long Bridge, Hanoi\" width=\"945\" height=\"628\" /></p> If you are landing in Hanoi at the Noi Bai International Airport, the best option for you is to book a Grab ride to your accommodation. The airport is quite away from the city center - almost 30 kilometers away from the Old District! <div data-gyg-href=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/default/activites.frame\" data-gyg-locale-code=\"en-US\" data-gyg-widget=\"activities\" data-gyg-number-of-items=\"3\" data-gyg-partner-id=\"781AB6P\" data-gyg-q=\"hanoi airport\"></div> <script async defer src=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js\"></script>  There are numerous methods on how to reach Hanoi from the airport. You can either board the bus 7 that goes to the Kim Ma Station, or the bus 17 that goes to the Long Bien Station. The ticket will cost you 5,000 VND (around 22 cents), and the ride will take one hour. There is also a new bus 86. It has Wi-Fi and will take you to the city center or directly to your accommodation for the price of 32,000 VND to 64,000 VND ($1,38 to $2,75). Be sure to check a <a href=\"http://www.vnu.edu.vn/ttsk/vietnamese/c1736/c1748/2009/07/n26392/hanoi_xebuyt_vnu_l1.jpg\">detailed Hanoi bus map</a> for convenience.  You can also book a Grab ride from the airport, although it may cost you more than the bus in some cases. Beware of fake Grab and taxi drivers who usually pull <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam\">various tourist scams</a>. <h3>Getting Around Hanoi</h3> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5630 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.getting-around-hanoi.jpg\" alt=\"Getting around Hanoi with the bus\" width=\"1024\" height=\"573\" />  You can board the city buses that connect the two most populated areas in Hanoi - Kim Ma and Yen Nghia. They come in red, yellow, and white colors, and the rates range from 5,000 to 10,000 VND (22 cents to 43 cents).  Another great option to get around Hanoi is to book a ride via the Grab smartphone app. You can book a car or even a motorbike taxi if you are feeling more adventurous. The prices will vary on the availability of the drivers, number of passengers, and the trip distance.  We advise you to avoid taxis as they are usually more expensive than Grab. They will often involve more hassle when it comes to negotiating a fair price.  Of course, you can always rent a motorbike in Hanoi, if you wish to brave the traffic on your own! The rental prices will vary depending on the business you choose.  Whether your choice of transport in Hanoi may be, there are numerous options to choose from for every budget and type of traveler. Make sure to read our <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/public-transportation-in-vietnam\">guide on public transportation in Vietnam </a>to get a better outlook. <h2>Where to Stay in Hanoi - Accommodation Options &amp; Prices</h2> Hanoi hosts thousands of different accommodation options.

Trucks from as far away as southern China start pulling into the city in the wee hours, unloading fruit and fresh veggies for restaurants and market vendors to re-sell the following day. The market kicks off at around 1 am and wraps up at 5 am, making it a fun thing to do in Hanoi at night.</p> <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get up early or stay up late, the choice is yours. Plan to arrive at the market at about 3 am when activity reaches its peak. It takes about 2 hours to explore the market thoroughly, after which you can walk along Long Bien Bridge and catch the breathtaking sunrise popping over skyscrapers.</p> <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long Bien is a wholesale market, so everything is displayed in excess – small mountains of pineapples, crates upon crates of mangoes and smelly durian. People rush back and forth through the market’s narrow alleys on a motorbike. As you meander along, watch your toes lest a rogue trolley hits you.</p> <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a good idea to pair Long Bien Night Market with Quang Ba Flower Market in Tay Ho, which is open from 2 am until 4 am daily.</p> <strong>p.s. </strong>if you only have a day or two in Hanoi, don\'t forget to read our <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/2-days-in-hanoi\">2 days in Hanoi itinerary</a> and plan an awesome trip. &nbsp; <em>Special thanks to Emily from Wander-Lush for this amazing entry.

It\'s not a new topic, but since we\'re passionate about Vietnam and had excellent experiences while exploring the country, we\'d love to give back to the community.  Media constantly broadcasting recent news about Corona Virus, and constant immigration changes make it very difficult for travelers to figure out rather travel or stay home. Usually, helpful Facebook groups became filled with people sharing news and statistics about the mighty Corona Virus. It\'s evident - we\'re in the state of panic, and we\'re all affected.  How does this current state of fear affect Vietnam\'s economy and tourism industry? Is it actually safe or even smart to travel around Vietnam these days? Let\'s find out together.  <strong>p.s. </strong>Since I assume we all know what\'s Corona Virus, how it affects the human body, and how it spreads, we\'re not going to talk about it. In case you\'re not sure about details or would love to learn more about it, check out the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus\">WHO official page</a> for more. <h2><strong>Corona Virus (Covid-19) in Vietnam </strong></h2> Since Vietnam directly borders with China, and Hanoi is just about 1.400 km away from Wuhan, the logical question arises - how serious is Corona Virus in Vietnam?  According to <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/\">Worldometers</a>, as of March 10th, Vietnam has reported 31 cases of which 16 are active. Whether the government declared the correct number of cases or it\'s a manipulation, it\'s not on to say. Everyone has their own thought and suspicions, but let\'s stick to research and statistics.  The Vietnamese government, according to official reports, had everything under control until the Vietnamese local didn\'t arrive back to Vietnam infected. She was attending <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3074159/vietnamese-jet-setter-coronavirus-guest-top-fashion-shows\">top fashion shows in Milan and Paris</a>, and upon her arrival to Hanoi, the whole Truc Bach street was closed and undergone disinfection.  As Vietnam is just next to China, one would think that it will be one of the most affected countries when it comes to a number of infected people. However, it\'s not the case, and it\'s fascinating how the Vietnamese government works hard to slow the pace of the pandemic. <p id=\"USAYdSK\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5707 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e67d4fea73a2.jpg\" alt=\"How serious is corona virus in Vietnam?\" width=\"1183\" height=\"784\" /></p> <em>It\'s essential to follow the latest news to get a better understanding of the situation in Vietnam.

There are speculations by visa agents that Italians, Iranians, and many other EU passport holders won\'t be able to get an invitation letter for entrance in the country.</li> </ul> The list goes on and on...  If we believe the government and its efforts to control the spreading of COVID-19, then we must say the government is doing a great job. Whether we\'re presented with accurate results or not, it\'s really not our field to discuss.  Anyway, the mighty COVID-19, even if there are only 31 reported cases in Vietnam, has a VERY HUGE impact on the Vietnamese economy.  According to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vietnam-prepares-economic-impact-of-coronavirus-2020-2\">Businessinsider</a>, here are a few shocking statistics: <ul>   <li>Businesses are having a direct trade with Chinese companies in the context of import or export already felt a huge impact.</li>   <li>The whole COVID-19 pandemic could potentially cause the Vietnamese GDP to drop by 1% this year.</li>   <li>Tourism is the most affected industry reporting losses anywhere between 30% - 60% compared to the last year. The damage in three months could reach a whopping $4 billion.</li> </ul> As you can see, the Corona Virus still doesn\'t have a huge health impact on the country (only 31 cases), but the economical and social impact is enormous!  Businesses, especially in hospitality and tourism, started to close due to the low amount of guests coming in, immigration laws are constantly changing, so we can\'t even predict what would be tomorrow. Also, expats who are working as English teachers are affected a lot as schools are closed. For instance, in Hanoi, the schools are <a href=\"https://chaohanoi.com/2020/03/07/schools-closed-onw-more-week-in-hanoi/\">officially closed till March 15th</a> without any certainty of opening. Significant events, such as F1 Hanoi race is postponed, all festivals and ceremonies, are getting closed too.  It leads us to another question... <h2><strong>Is It Safe to Travel Around Vietnam Right Now?</strong></h2> Well, if you\'re planning to travel to Vietnam during the Corona Virus outbreak, there are a few things to consider before taking a trip: <ul>   <li>Check with your airline company if they are operating and if the flights will be delayed or canceled.</li>   <li>Check your tours and accommodation bookings.</li>   <li>Be in constant touch with your visa agent or immigration office since they tend to change visa policies for individual countries a few times per day.</li> </ul> I genuinely believe that Corona Virus outbreak and the whole situation is made to divide us even more. People started to associate Chinese or even Asian people as Corona Virus itself, which creates a certain level of racism and hate towards Asian people. There is such a small percentage that the virus will kill you, but how fast the virus is spreading is just crazy. It\'s the first pandemic in the history of the human race that spreads so rapidly. The news is covering everything and I believe it\'s a huge media propaganda going on.  Of course, I don\'t say you should just go with the opinion that Corona Virus is fake and don\'t take precautions measures while traveling, but I assume the media makes it much more severe than it is.  <img class=\"wp-image-5702 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e67cc7adc1bc.jpg\" alt=\"Death Statistics\" width=\"513\" height=\"669\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Source <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/\">Woldometers</a></div>  The picture above shows the current statistics of different causes of death. Currently, 4,264 people died from Corona Virus. Just check how many people died from seasonal flu or how many mothers died while giving birth.  It\'s true that Corona Virus spreads pretty fast, but is it a real threat to humanity, I don\'t think so.  So to answer the question - traveling to Vietnam and around the region is entirely safe, but some measures of precautions are welcome. <h2><strong>How to Prepare Yourself for Traveling Around Vietnam During Corona Virus Outbreak</strong></h2> <p id=\"qaYgcvQ\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5706 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e67d48373b59.jpg\" alt=\"Face masks in Vietnam\" width=\"1181\" height=\"788\" /></p> According to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html\">CDC.org</a>, Corona Virus (COVID-19) spreads through direct contact. If you\'re in direct contact or just being around infected people, the chances are high you\'re going to get infected. What can you do to prevent getting infected?  Take care of your hygiene!  Get high quality, alcohol-based hand sanitizer and wash your hands periodically during the day. Also, be sure to invest in a proper respiratory mask, preferably N95 masks, as these are tighter than regular medical masks and prevent smaller particles from passing.  Be sure to invest in high-quality multivitamins and Vitamin C to boost your immune system. Also, don\'t forget to sleep well and exercise regularly, even when you\'re on the road.  <hr />  The situation with the Corona Virus is currently not looking good. The virus spreads rapidly and who knows how many people will get infected until we find an effective cure. Some scientists predict that around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/coronavirus-expert-warns-infection-could-reach-60-of-worlds-population\">60 - 70% of the world population might be infected</a>.  It might not be the best time to travel around Vietnam, but even if you decide to go, just be more careful and take precaution measures and you\'ll be fine. Also, don\'t forget to always check with your airlines and immigration to be aligned with the latest updates.

Two years ago, I thought I\'ll stay in Vietnam just for three months to complete my volunteering project in beautiful Nghe An province, but I ended up calling Vietnam my home. It was so unexpected and unplanned, but I can\'t be happier with that decision. I am so fortunate to have a chance to live in different places around the country, including one of the poorest provinces, Nghe An and one of the fastest developing cities, Da Nang.  Continue reading if you\'d like to know the pros and cons of living in Vietnam.  Please keep in mind it\'s my subjective opinion so that it may differ from other people\'s experiences. Let\'s start! <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Cons of Living in Vietnam</strong></h2> <h2><strong>High Pollution Levels</strong></h2> The majority of developing countries face the pollution problem, and Vietnam falls into the same bucket. Pollution is everywhere, and it\'s unfortunate to see how short term development is favored over long-term consequences. I can understand that since the country still faces high poverty rates, and fast-paced growth provides jobs and drives the economy. Anyway, the consequences are real. Lately, Hanoi hits the highest on the <a href=\"https://vietnaminsider.vn/why-hanoi-and-hcm-city-ranked-among-top-three-worlds-most-polluted-cities/\">list of the most polluted cities in the world</a>.  Air quality is pretty bad in the cities, and on some days, you can notice the layer of smog in the distance. The air is much better in the countryside, but the life quality struggles, especially for expats as lacking infrastructure is real.  Another shocking thing I\'ve experienced is a culture of littering. As I was living near the beach in Nghe An, I loved to spend time on the beach. Unfortunately, beaches and surrounding area serve as a garbage dump for locals. You can find all kinds of plastics, styrofoam, nylon, fishermen, nets, etc. The majority of that trash ends up in the sea, and gradually over time, it affects a marine life that\'s the primary source of income and life in the region. I guess it\'s a lack of education on the matter, and I\'m not blaming people, but I believe we, especially expats, should work hard to educate locals and save the environment.  I\'ve experienced small kids aggressively throwing covers of candy or plastic glasses on the road during the motorbike drive. The parents seem not to care at all, which again touches the point of lack of education.  Currently, especially in bigger cities, the younger students and professionals started to show an initiative about saving the environment so you can join many beach clean-ups, educational events, and fundraisers, which is quite impressive!  The video below shows one of the best views in Vietnam - the top of Hai Van Pass. You can see yourself how much trash and plastics is around...  <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ETCkhz9jFYw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <h2><strong>Chaotic Traffic (You\'ll Soon Get Used to It!)</strong></h2> Alright, probably you\'ve already heard about Vietnamese traffic, so I will be short here. I was extremely shocked to see traffic after I\'ve landed in Hanoi. Since the tax on car imports is enormous, people\'s primary vehicle is a motorbike. Did you know that officially there are around <a href=\"https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/vietnam-remains-kingdom-of-motorbikes-as-sales-rev-up-in-2016-3527969.html\">45 million registered motorbikes</a> operating daily? Imagine that! It\'s close to one bike for every two people, which is just mindblowing. Now imagine that amount of motorcycles on the roads...crazy, huh?  Once you start driving and get comfortable, you\'ll notice that there is a flow in traffic that everyone follows. The majority of people are aware of each other and traffic, most of the time, goes smoothly. Don\'t be surprised about the constant honking since it serves as an indicator to show others that your are in the traffic.  Be extra careful of trucks and buses since, in Vietnam, there is an unwritten rule - the priority goes to the bigger vehicle.  <strong><em>Looking to drive a motorbike in Vietnam?

The most significant disadvantage is food hygiene or lack of the same since locals prepare food on the street. The air quality, insects, dust, non-drinkable tap water, wild rats are just a few aspects that lower food hygiene.  I\'ve been talking with many expats, and some of them are very concerned about food hygiene. Many people traveling and living here got stomach problems related to food. Luckily for me, I\'ve never experienced any problem with food in Vietnam (knocking on wood), and I enjoy street food every day. <h2><strong>Rapid Development and Construction Everywhere</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5734 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e692e221b0e9.jpg\" alt=\"Construction is everywhere in Vietnam.\" width=\"1120\" height=\"756\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Construction is everywhere, especially in low developed regions such as Nghe An province. When it comes to the countryside, it\'s sad to see mid-aged women working on construction sites.</div>  Rapid development isn\'t necessarily a bad thing as it creates job opportunities for locals and improves their quality of life. Anyway, in some places, the construction and development pace is out of control, which has many adverse effects. For example, in Da Nang (An Thuong area), it\'s so hard to find a single street without construction work going on. It\'s very shocking to see that the majority of construction workers are middle-aged women who work from morning till dark (sometimes during the night, too). I must mention that I haven\'t noticed women working on construction sites in the big cities, but in the countryside. If you know more about the reasons behind it, please let us know.  When it comes to more significant projects, like building large hotels or infrastructure, the majority of workers aren\'t Vietnamese people, but \'imported\' Chinese workers. How much does rapid development improve the life quality of the regular Vietnamese family?  I have to mention that apartment hunting is profoundly affected by rapid construction in the cities. While I was living in Da Nang, An Thuong area was going through significant infrastructure upgrades, which translates to dust, unbearable noise, and bad traffic. It\'s tough to live next to a large construction site, so when you\'re hunting for your next apartment, be sure to rent the place for a few nights before signing a contract. Thank me later for that. :) <h2><strong>Occasional Power &amp; Internet Outage</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5731 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e692cc19db84.jpg\" alt=\"Electrical wires in Hanoi\" width=\"1495\" height=\"840\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Just look at the wires, and you\'ll understand why power blackouts are a regular thing.</div>  As in the majority of developing countries, electrical infrastructure doesn\'t follow the pace of development, so it\'s not a strange thing to experience a few power or internet outages per day. When I was living in the countryside, we\'ve experienced a power outage almost every day, and it was very frustrating. Anyway, you have to embrace it if you decide to live or travel in the countryside. That\'s one of the main reasons I\'ve mentioned that the countryside might not be the best option for expats, especially if you need a stable internet connection and electricity.  When it comes to cities, the situation is a way better, but still, there are some occasional power blackouts. In Da Nang, for example, when the construction site is around, you can count for a few outages per day. Also, sometimes the trucks break the electrical wires, and it causes the blackout in the whole block. The good thing is that the majority of apartments/cafes have power generators in case of a prolonged power outage. <h2><strong>Language Barrier is REAL</strong></h2> The language barrier is REAL, and sometimes, it gets tough to establish a basic conversation with locals. When I\'ve first arrived in Vietnam, I\'ve been living in a rural province of Nghe An, where I could count on the fingers of one hand people who could speak English. At first, it\'s bizarre, but after a while, you understand that people living in rural areas simply don\'t have time and money to learn English. Plus, on top of that, you are the foreigner in their country, and you should adjust. These people are hard workers leaving their sweat in the rice fields to put the food on the table. The younger population, teenagers, and primary school kids are learning conversational English at a swift pace. I\'ve met a few teenagers, and we could speak and understand each other with the support of Google Translate.  I was teaching school kids English as a part of a volunteering project in Nghe An, and you can read my volunteering experience <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/starlight-english-center-vietnam\">here</a>.  Not to forget, Google Translate in Vietnam helps a lot, even in the remotest areas. The translation isn\'t perfect all the time, but people seem to understand the context, which makes communication way more manageable.  <img class=\"wp-image-5746 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e6b84182e620.jpg\" alt=\"Language exchange in Da Nang, Vietnam.\" width=\"1168\" height=\"872\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> I was helping young Vietnamese people to improve their English, and in exchange, I\'ve met beautiful people that I can call friends these days. Also, you can learn a lot about the culture, traditions, challenges these people face, and learn the basics of Vietnamese. Such a win-win situation.</div>  When it comes to big cities, the level of English is a way higher, which means the majority of younger people know the basics, but only a small percentage can hold a conversation. The demand for English is enormous, and the best example shows the rapid growth of English so-called schools or centers on each step.  If you\'re planning to relocate to Vietnam, start learning Vietnamese from day 1. Not only it will help you in connecting with locals, but you\'ll be able to get better prices, learn more about Vietnamese culture, and it\'s fun! I\'m currently learning Vietnamese in exchange for sharing my language. The best way to acquire Vietnamese is to meet local people who\'re looking to improve their English. Such a win-win situation. <h2><strong>Loud Karaoke Bars</strong></h2> Alright, this doesn\'t necessarily need to be a downside, but these fancy karaoke bars can turn in your biggest nightmare overnight. Singing karaoke with friends and family is one of the staple cultural activities of Vietnamese people, so expect a lot of karaoke bars.  Why are these bars a downside? Well, if you\'re living in bigger cities such as Da Nang, in some areas, there are multiple karaoke bars next to each other. The isolation is close to non-existent, and people usually participate in this intense activity during the night, so you can guess it. It\'s very noisy and sometimes annoying to hear drunk people trying to sing.  When you\'re searching for the apartment, I recommend exploring the surrounding area and booking a few nights before signing a lease since you\'ll get a better understanding of the area. <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Pros of Living in Vietnam</strong></h2> <h2><strong>Friendly Vietnamese People</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5741 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e693419f2b64.jpg\" alt=\"Friendly Vietnamese people.\" width=\"1506\" height=\"841\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Randomly got invited by the local family that we\'ve met at the very moment. We were sharing our music, they were sharing their music, we drank loads of beer and ate delicious food. Vietnamese people are awesome!</div>  So, the story goes like this. I\'ve been driving my old and broken backpacker\'s Win and in the middle of nowhere, I ended up without fuel. I accepted the fact that I\'m going to push the bike for a while on an extreme heat until I find a gas station. After 5 minutes, I\'m about to give up and wait for the sun to goes down a bit, but here come the locals. They didn\'t ask anything, they\'ve just put their leg on my bike and pushed me. It was shocking, funny, and dangerous, but they reduced my struggle. Another story was when I was driving around the highlands and got caught in a massive rain. I\'ve stopped near some house to get the raincoat and continue driving, but locals get out and insisted that I cover from the rain in their home.  I could write a whole book with anecdotes of <a href=\"https://www.asabbatical.com/article/everything-you-should-know-about-vietnamese-people\">friendly Vietnamese people</a>. Some people will tell that Vietnamese people are generous because they expect something in return. I would strongly disagree regarding the general population, but for sure, there are some people, especially in touristic places, who\'re pretending to be friendly just to sell you something. If you\'re traveling around tourist places, be sure to prepare yourself and learn about <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam\">common scams in Vietnam</a> before bragging that Vietnamese people just want your money.  Anyway, Vietnamese people are amicable and kind. They are always ready to help, share a broad smile that makes up even the worst day, and can listen and understand. I\'m a people\'s person and always trying to form a connection and empathy with people.  Please have in mind that it\'s my subjective experience. I\'ve been traveling around Vietnam for the past two years and really can\'t remember any bad experience with people. <h2><strong>A Heaven for Foodie Lovers</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5739 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e69329296b45.jpg\" alt=\"Banh Mi street food.\" width=\"1144\" height=\"862\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> My favorite Vietnamese street food is, by far a crispy Banh Mi with eggs, pork, and fresh vegetables. Also, I love to add loads of soy sauce and chill for extra flavor.</div>  Hands down to the best cuisine I\'ve had a chance to try. Vietnamese food culture, or more specifically, street food culture makes everyone wondering about mouthwatering dishes came straight from the source.  <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-street-food\">Vietnamese food</a> is exceptionally fresh and diverse, which makes me believe you simply can\'t end up without the ideas of what to eat next. I was living in Da Nang for a year, and I probably tried more than 50 authentic dishes from the region.  Oh, did I mention that food differs from region to region? Some areas serve the same food, but people use different spices, herbs, or ways of preparation, which ends up like a completely different dish.  If you ever have the chance to explore the whole country, you\'ll soon realize the specialties differ as you progress to the north or south. For instance, the north is known for its authentic Pho, while the central region is known for its delicious bowl of Mi Quang.  On top of having abundant choices when it comes to eating, the food is extremely affordable, and you can find it on each step.  Many times it happened that I didn\'t know what I\'d exactly love to eat, so I just drive the bike around until I\'ve found a friendly local with a broad smile preparing food on the street.  What amazes me the most is how affordable the food is. If you\'re eating on the street, you can expect to pay anywhere from 10,000 - 70,000 for a hearty meal. Have in mind that noodle soups usually costs in the 30,000 VND range, while rice combinations can cost a bit more, depending on how much food you have on your plate. <h2><strong>Vibrant Coffee Scene</strong></h2> <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jTbiGpXss7I\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  Whoever traveled around Vietnam knows about <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-coffee-culture\">Vietnamese coffee</a>. It would be a sin no to try a sip of this hot rhapsody, and once you try, it\'s tough to get used to any other coffee. I\'m a huge coffee addict who loves simplicity, so I usually go with standard coffee with milk and ice (caphe sua da).  Vietnamese people tend to use a lot of Robusta beans since it\'s very cheap and tasty. Some upscale cafes have different beans on the menu, such as Arabica beans from regions such as Da Lat, or even Ethiopia or Colombia. Anyway, a cup of Vietnamese coffee is robust and features a pleasant coffee aroma and sweetened taste of condensed milk.  Wanna learn how to prepare an authentic Vietnamese coffee with milk? Check our detailed guide <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide\">here</a>.  Locals are religious about their coffee breaks, which usually takes place all-around day. There is no way that a Vietnamese person will reject an invitation for a talk with a coffee. Local coffee shops cater to locals who bet on the cards or play Chinese chess during their break. Also, quite popular are gaming cafes where youngsters stare at their phones and play popular multiplayer games.  I really love the coffee scene, not only for the coffee itself but also for the ambient that gives me a focus required for my freelance business. In some bigger cafe franchises such as High5, Highlands Coffee or House of Cha, you may find a perfect spot for working on your laptop. Also, locals tend to study and work there so it\'s just an ideal place to get some work done. If you\'re in Da Nang and looking for a cozy cafe where you can work online, here\'s the list of all <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/working-cafes-in-da-nang\">work-friendly places in Da Nang</a>.  The coffee culture is just a part of colorful Vietnamese culture, and if you\'re a coffee addict like me, you\'ll get along. Not to forget, coffee is exceptionally affordable, and menus offer abundant choices. <h2><strong>Breathtaking Landscape </strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5740 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e6933677ff51.jpg\" alt=\"A view from Mua Cave.\" width=\"1210\" height=\"861\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> Stunning views from the top of Mua Caves, Ninh Binh.</div>  People associate Vietnam with many things such as friendly people, mouthwatering food, beautiful women, strong coffee, but we can\'t miss a breathtaking landscape. Hands down, Vietnam is the land of diversity, and landscape definitely falls into that description.  I was fortunate enough that upon my arrival, I had a chance to visit the stunning Halong Bay and Tam Coc area. Whoever plans to visit Halong Bay, I can\'t recommend more <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/halong-bay-vietnam\">climbing to Bai Tho mountain</a> and enjoying the view over the city and the bay.  Once I sat on the motorbike (it took a while), I\'ve experienced extreme freedom in going off the beaten path and honestly exploring the diversity of landscape in Vietnam. The north is known for its high peaks, terrace rice fields, narrow roads, and solely breathtaking views. If you\'re about to travel north, don\'t forget to drive a stunning <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/ha-giang-loop\">Ha Giang loop</a>. Once you start going south, you\'ll experience windy mountain passes offering stunning views over cities (Hai Van I\'m talking about you!), as well as dense jungle roads near the Laos border. Kontum and Pleiku area features the heart of Central Highlands, where the majority of ethnic groups live, so not only you\'re going to experience a stunning landscape, but also, you\'re going to see a different way of living.  I\'d say that the south is a bit more specific when it comes to beaches as the tiny islands surround the coast. Once you proceed further south, around Mui Ne area, you\'ll experience a sand desert out of nowhere. Can Tho city is known as a Mekong Delta area where you can explore river streams and how life goes on there.  Vietnam has it all, and it\'s a very diverse country landscape wise. In my opinion, by far, the best way to truly experience the landscape and everything else Vietnam offers is by <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam\">getting a second-hand motorbike</a> and go on a lifetime adventure.  Looking for a beautiful motorbike route from Hanoi to Saigon? We\'ve traveled from <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/hanoi-to-saigon\">Hanoi to Saigon on the bikes in 30 days</a>, so don\'t forget to check it out. <h2><strong>Lively Expat Community</strong></h2> If you\'re looking to form meaningful connections with fellow travelers or expats, you\'re lucky as the bigger cities feature a vibrant expat community.  Since I was living in Da Nang, I can speak for that city and its expat community. What I\'d like to mention is that at the beginning, I was mainly hanging around the foreigners in An Thuong area, but after a while, I\'ve got a feeling that I was missing out from authentic Vietnamese culture. That was the moment when I stopped hanging so much around expat area and start to interact mainly with Vietnamese people. Currently, I\'m balancing things out, and it works wonders for me.  I\'ve met so many people who shared the same experience. Getting to Vietnam to learn more about the country, its people and culture, ending up being surrounded by westerners all the time. What are your thoughts on it?  In Da Nang, you have a large and helpful expat group with hefty of valuable advice and recommendations. Also, if you\'re a digital nomad or would love to know more about the lifestyle, there is an active DN group with weekly meetups, which is fantastic for forming relationships and friendships.  I can\'t speak for other cities, but from the Facebook groups, I can tell Saigon and Hanoi feature a way bigger expat groups with more activities and events going on.  Don\'t worry, even if you don\'t speak Vietnamese, you\'ll find your pack of people in Vietnam. :) <h2><strong>Affordable Costs of Living</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5749 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e6b881cdf565.jpg\" alt=\"my regular vietnamese meal\" width=\"1157\" height=\"864\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> This is how my regular Vietnamese lunch looks like. It\'s a pretty healthy and filling meal. All you can see on the table costs around 30,000 VND, which is roughly $1.25.</div>  Expats enjoy a pretty affordable cost of living compared to western countries in Vietnam. You can live a pretty decent life, filled with activities, having your own motorbike and fully furnished apartment, eating out every meal without breaking the bank.  I\'ve been writing about my experience while <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/living-in-da-nang\">living in Da Nang</a> before, so you can check a detailed living cost breakdown. Please note that I\'m not partying hard, but I spend my money on other things such as gas, a motorbike, and loads of coffee! :D  Living 2 minutes from the beautiful beach, having a full street of diverse street food, and tiny cafes is everything I need. I was spending about $600 per month and didn\'t miss anything.  Please note that I was also saving the money while building my business, so this might be a meager cost. For a pretty comfortable life having a modern apartment in expat area, going out almost every night, and not worrying about the money, you can easily spend $1,000 per month. Anyway, for the quality of the life you get for your money spent, you simply can\'t beat it. <h2><strong>Latin Alphabet</strong></h2> This one is huge, especially for someone who loves to explore. In Vietnam, the popular way to explore the country is by driving your motorbike. Everything, the traffic signs, menus, and navigation signs use the Latin alphabet. It makes it extremely easy to navigate around the country where you possibly don\'t understand more than 10 words.  While driving on the open roads, you don\'t need to use navigation. Once you\'re in the city and looking for a specific place, the navigation comes handy. When it comes to food, drinks, nightlife, and all other fun, you\'ll find everything easy to understand. Also, in tourist places, you can expect menus on English, which is a huge plus, but also a sign of tourist prices. :D  Anyway, navigating around the country and understanding what you\'re ordering is extremely easy, mainly because of the Latin alphabet. <h2><strong>Pleasant Weather</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5742 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e6935d629534.jpg\" alt=\"A nice weather and the beach in Hoi An, Central Vietnam.\" width=\"1160\" height=\"707\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> One beautiful sunny day in Hoi An, An Bang beach.</div>  Since I\'m coming from a country known for its cold winters and sweltering and dry summers, a climate in Vietnam was a pleasant surprise. At first, I was living in Nghe An, and the province is known for a super dry wind blowing from neighboring Laos during April - June. If you ask me to describe hell, then it would be staying in the place with a dry Lao wind pouring on you.  Da Nang was a pleasant surprise as the majority of the time, you\'ll experience sunny weather perfect for the beach. You can check my full article explaining different <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/best-time-to-visit-da-nang\">seasons in Da Nang</a> and finding the best time to visit the city. Anyway, you can expect sunny and stable weather from March to October. From October to December, the temperature started to decrease while the weather became a bit unstable slowly. A period from December to February is known as a wet season, which features a heavy rainfall, occasional floods, and overall, depressive weather to live in.  Probably the average temperature for the whole Vietnam sits in the mid-20s (celsius) degrees. Also, the critical thing to mention is that the south experiences a monsoon climate, which means half of the year is a wet season. Prepare for daily rains and constant floods. <h2><strong>Extra - Bum Guns Everywhere!</strong></h2> Alright, at first, bum guns may sound like a weird thing, but believe me, once you leave Vietnam, you\'ll immediately look for the ways to install one in your house. Once you learn how to use it properly and apply enough water pressure, then we\'re talking about the comfort you simply can\'t abandon.  Bum guns are the best! :)  <hr />  After all being said, Vietnam has its pros and cons, but in my opinion, the pros hugely outweigh the cons. Vietnam is by far my favorite country to live in, and I can proudly call it my second home. <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>What are your thoughts?

Well, if you can positively answer the question, then you will find Vietnam as an attractive place! One of the many reasons is the abundance of temples and pagodas around the whole country sharing the stories of ancestors. I had a chance to explore many hidden spots in Vietnam and learn about the history, but what amazes me the most, is the abundance of Vietnam temples and pagodas. You can stumble upon beautiful temples on each step, even in the remotest areas that will catch your attention. </span>  Since the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Vietnam\">history of Vietnam dates 4000 years ago</a>, the fact gives you the idea of how many temples you can explore in Vietnam. I had a very tough task to pick among more than 50 temples I\'ve had a chance to visit during my journey around the country. If I missed any temple and you believe it should be on the list, please add your thought in the section below, and I\'d be more than happy to add it. :)  So if you have only a limited time to explore Vietnam, how do you choose which Vietnam pagodas and temples to visit? <h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">#1- Tran Quoc Pagoda - Hanoi</span></strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5780 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e6cefcf24266.jpg\" alt=\"Tran Quoc Pagoda - Hanoi\" width=\"1184\" height=\"777\" />  <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The majority of travelers land their feet in the capital city of Hanoi when first arriving in Vietnam. The capital is a great choice to start your trip as it will give you a sweet introduction to Vietnamese culture. Also, there are many beautiful areas and things to do in the capital, including exploring the oldest temple located in the heart of West Lake. </span>  <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tran Quoc Pagoda is the complex you can’t miss once you’re wandering around beautiful West Lake. Many magazines listed this authentic Vietnamese pagoda as the most beautiful pagoda or temple in the world, so it’s definitely a place you want to visit. </span>  <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Pagoda itself was built around the 6th century under the reign of Emperor Ly Nam De. During the centuries, emperors made many changes around the complex due to security and comfort reasons. Emperors mainly used this temple during holidays while they were relaxing in the company of close associates, friends, and family. Once you set your foot around, you will feel a royalty and vastness of the place. </span>  <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The central tower is 15 meters tall, and it features 11 diverse levels. There are few tiny buildings around the complex where you can burn incense and pray as well as a small museum that provides interesting information about that part of history. Since it\'s a Buddhist pagoda, many locals and foreigners pay a visit on 1st or 15th in the Lunar calendar, so you can expect huge crowds. There is also a specific dress code you have to follow, such as wearing long sleeves and removing shoes when entering. </span>  <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Tran Quoc Pagoda is a place you simply can\'t miss while strolling around West Lake.</span>  I suggest to time your visit around sunset hours since West Lake is the sunset spot in Hanoi. Bring your camera, take some fresh mango and chili salt, and admire the breathtaking views.  <strong>p.s. </strong>Having only 2 days for exploring beautiful Hanoi?

The site looks surreal as it is a home of thousands of limestones, green rice fields, and tiny rivers craving the paths around stunning mountains. The place seems breathtaking, which might be a reason it’s a home of the largest Buddhist complex in Southeast Asia - Bai Dinh Pagoda. </span>  <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Pagoda itself was built around 1000 years ago, but some parts of the Buddhist complex were built just 10 years ago. It gives a complex an unique combination of modern and ancient architecture. The amazing thing you can do while you’re exploring the complex is to climb to the top of the pagoda and enjoy breathtaking views of the surrounding place. </span>  <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The complex is famous for many things and holds many records when it comes to temples and pagodas. Did you know that Bai Dinh pagoda features the biggest bell in Vietnam, weighing 36 tons? Also, there are more than 100 statues around the complex, which says much about the vastness of the complex. Just walking around this pagoda gives you chills as you feel the energy of historical importance. </span>  <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Be sure that you visit Bai Dinh pagoda before 5 pm as they are closing the gates afterward. </span>  <strong>p.s.</strong> Once you\'re in the Tam Coc area, you should definitely pay a visit to Mua Caves. It\'s a stunning Buddhist temple that features a 500-stairs climb that will greet you with breathtaking views over the area. <ul>   <li><strong>Working hours: </strong>07:00 - 18:00</li>   <li><strong>Address: </strong>Xa, Gia Sing, Gia Vien, Ninh Binh, Vietnam</li>   <li><strong>Fee: </strong>Free entrance (15.000 VND parking fee + 30.000 VND electric car)</li> </ul> <div data-gyg-q=\"bai dinh\" data-gyg-partner-id=\"781AB6P\" data-gyg-number-of-items=\"3\" data-gyg-widget=\"activities\" data-gyg-locale-code=\"en-US\" data-gyg-href=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/default/activites.frame\"></div> <script async defer src=\"https://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js\"></script> <h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">#3- My Son Ruins - Quang Nam Province</span></strong></h2> <p id=\"iZzdSmD\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5783 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e6cf0bed679f.jpg\" alt=\"My Son Sanctuary\" width=\"1133\" height=\"754\" /></p> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">People often compare My Son Ruins to world-famous Angkor Wat, but is it really like that? Well, My Son is listed as the UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it attracts thousands of tourists annually. The complex itself lies in a very tiny area in the mountains located about 50 km southern from Hoi An. </span>  <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">My Son Ruins is the cluster of Hindu temples that date from the 4th century. Around the whole complex, you can discover 8 temples and 70 monuments. The majority of the site remains in the ruins partly because the site served as a military base during the war. </span>  <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The best way to visit the ruins is by hiring a car or rent a motorbike from Hoi An or Da Nang. It takes about 1 - 2 hours to reach the site and to explore a whole complex, you will need another few hours. The best time to visit the ruins is in the morning since it\'s not hot and you can still cover in the shades, and there are not so many tourists around. Not to forget, the entrance price is 150,000 VND (around $7). </span>  <strong>p.s.</strong> While in Quang Nam, don\'t forget to try their iconic bowl of Mi Quang.

The whole complex is very vast as the width of the surrounding walls is about 2 kilometers. You have many different ways to explore and experience the city - guided or self-guided. If you decide to take a tour guide, expect to be in the city for at least 5 hours as the place is rich in history and you can learn much. </span>  <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There are many buildings, temples, and small pagodas around the Imperial City. Also, the views of Hue city that you can get from the highest point is just majestic - makes you feel like an emperor.

Well, what could be better than visiting majestic Cao Dai Temple located in Tay Ninh (about 100 km northwest from Saigon)? Cao Dai Temple is the newest temple on the list, and its construction was completed in 1955. It\'s hard you\'ll stumble upon a similar temple since this one features the mixture in traditions, which translates to pretty odd but colorful architecture.  The temple represents <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caodaism\">Caodaism</a>, which is unique to the region. The unique religion features a blend of various religions, including Islam, Confucianism, Taoism, Christianity, and Buddhism. Cadoaists share a fascinating perspective stating that all religions are the same, and united they seek for tolerance and peace in the world. A pretty fresh perspective that differs from popular religious views today. I personally don\'t follow any religion because of many reasons, but I really appreciate a belief where followers are talking about peace, freedom, and unity.  The best aspect of exploring the Cao Dai Temple is observing prayers. People wear colorful robes, and women sit separated from men. These separations and colorful dresses make the whole praying process fascinating and picturesque.  Once you enter the complex, you should follow a strict dress code - cover your shoulders and knees, and remove your shoes to show respect.

The complex was built at the beginning of the 20th century by immigrants from Guangzhou province located in China. The story of pagoda started when a regular Chinese man named Luu Minh migrated from mainland China to South Vietnam to work. As he was a firm believer and follower of Buddhism, he wanted to create a worship place for his daily praying sessions, and that\'s how this majestic pagoda finds itself in the middle of Saigon.  The architecture looks pretty colorful and attractive, and the whole complex spreads over whopping 2,000 square meters. There are many tiny temples, picturesque statues, beautiful paintings, and worship places where people can pray or simply wonder the beauty of the complex. The complex features three main halls filled with Buddha statues, different gods, tigers, dragons, and other mythical creatures.  Since Jade Emperor Pagoda is an extremely popular temple in Vietnam, especially after <a href=\"https://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/vietnam-in-photos/157017/president-obama-visits-ngoc-hoang-temple-in-hcm-city.html\">Obama\'s visit in 2016.</a>, it\'s imperative to time your visit carefully.

Bánh Đúc Nóng is a unique dish that originates from Northern Vietnam, but you can also find it all over the other Vietnamese regions. It is yet another soup, as Vietnam has a lot of amazing soup dishes, but this one is a different beast of its own!  Of course, this dish is so much more than goo. It features balanced flavors that are quite distinct, like with every other Vietnamese soup. The broth of the soup is always made from pork, and the texture is made from glutinous rice flour. From the terminology perspective, \"bánh dúc\" is the name for the glutinous texture, and \"nong\" is hot. Do not mistake this dish for Bánh Đúc, as it is a similar dish, with the same base, but it\'s not a soup. So, if you see Bánh Đúc on the street food stall, try to ask for the Bánh Đúc Nóng to get this amazing soup served right on your table.  After the broth and the glutinous rice are in the bowl, there come the toppings that add the mentioned distinct flavors to this tasty soup. Usually, the toppings are fried onions, fresh tofu slices, fresh herbs, and minced pork meat cooked with black mushrooms. The mushrooms balance out the sweetness of the glutinous rice and pork, while the crispy tofu slices and fried onions give that crunchy feel to balance it all out. To top it all off, the fresh herbs give extra freshness, to sweet, salty, and savory zest. The great thing about this soup is even though different tastes are mixed, everything keeps its individuality, so every spoon may be a bit different!  You can discover this amazing street food all over Hanoi Old Quarter. Just look for the Bánh Đúc sign and you are good to go!

Bún ốc is as traditional as it gets with a broth of strong scent amplified by fried onions, with a soft and naturally sweet taste. Of course, we mustn\'t forget the rice vermicelli that is inside this soup, which is usually made in small parts and is not separated like your usual Bún. Usually, both big and small snails can be found in this soup, that are fried to give them that crispy crunch. Most locals will also put inside some fresh herbs, fried banana, and soy cheese; to give this soup the signature yellow color.

That information was a huge yet positive shock for us before arriving in Vietnam, but after a few days, you realize that everyone enjoys their cup of strong Vietnamese coffee!  The relaxing morning walks around bustling cities were very memorable for us since you can see people sitting and chilling on small chairs literally on the street while enjoying the sips of the coffee. In small streets, you can even smell the taste of the coffee.  Coffee in Vietnam is a huge part of the culture, and everyone enjoys their coffee breaks in the morning, afternoon, and in between. When we first arrived in Vietnam, as coffee lovers, we couldn\'t help ourselves not to do the same - sitting tiny chairs, observing the constant moving life while enjoying the sips of very delicious and strong coffee.  In this article, we want to share all the experiences, observations, and knowledge we\'ve got during our time in Vietnam when we\'re talking about Vietnamese coffee culture.  Brew yourself a coffee and find a cozy and comfortable place for this read (it\'s a long one!). <h2><strong>Vietnamese Coffee Culture - A Brief History of Vietnamese Coffee</strong></h2> <img src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e78fa0eb5e33.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnamese coffee culture is extremely strong and rooted in traditions. \" />  The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production_in_Vietnam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">history of Vietnamese coffee</a> dated from the middle of the 19th century when French colonialists introduced aromatic black beans to Vietnam. The industry started with mass-production because colonialists wanted to pump the profits out of the country as fast as possible. It was working like a charm during the colonial era, but after the 1950s, coffee production started to decline drastically.  The majority of coffee fields were situated in Central Highlands, the bordering area with Laos and Cambodia, which was the place of the bloodiest battles during the war. The war lasted for more than 20 years, and it left the Vietnamese economy on the knees.  The coffee fields, potent plants, and equipment were partly destroyed, the people left the area, and unexploded bombs still remain. It was very risky and costly to start with coffee production all over again.  However, the ruling Communist Party at that period decided to invest in coffee production as they saw it as an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%90%E1%BB%95i_M%E1%BB%9Bi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">opportunity for economic recovery</a>.  For instance, the coffee production jumped from 0.1% during the war to a whopping 30% some 40 years later. Nowadays, Vietnam is the second-largest producer and exporter of Robusta coffee beans in the world. The production process of Robusta beans is way cheaper, and beans consist of more caffeine levels, which is ideal for western and fast-paced markets. On the other hand, Arabica beans grow on a higher elevation, so you can find massive fields and farms around beautiful Da Lat and Buon Ma Thuot.  The coffee industry employs more than 3 million locals and drives a steady growth. Almost every country in the world imports Vietnamese coffee since it\'s affordable without lacking quality.  After learning about the coffee culture and its history, it\'s not a strange thing to smell coffee aroma on every step in Vietnam.  <strong>Storytime:</strong> After our epic <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/hanoi-to-saigon\">motorbike trip from Hanoi to Saigon</a>, it was time to say goodbye to David and Lovel. They left for Croatia and I was planning my next trip around Vietnam, of course sitting in one of the tiny coffee shops somewhere in Ho Chi Minh city. I\'ve figured out that I\'d love to explore Central Highlands and learn more about the coffee, so I\'ve planned a route from HCMC to Da Lat, Buon Ma Thuot, Pleiku, and Kontum. It\'s definitely a route for every coffee lover! The mountainous region features windy roads, mountains touching the clouds and coffee fields surrounding you. It was a blast to drive around the region.  Once, when I was leaving Buon Ma Thuot to Kontum, there was a local who was driving extremely fast with me (no traffic around there). We as fast a Chinese backpackers\' bike can go for a good 30 minutes until we reached a traffic light in the middle of nowhere. He said something on Vietnamese and showed a thumbs up, and I returned the same. We didn\'t know how to talk, but he asked universally understandable word - Ca Phe? I agreed with a wide smile!  <img class=\"wp-image-5931 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e84d3d76829e.jpg\" alt=\"coffee lovers around the country\" width=\"655\" height=\"870\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> This local is a LEGEND!</div> <h2><strong>What is Special About Vietnamese Coffee</strong></h2> There are two main types of coffee beans - Arabica and Robusta. Arabica requires much more effort to grow since it\'s only growing in high places, and its maintenance requires loads of resources. Also, Arabica has up to 2% of the caffeine in the beans which translates into a mild and pleasant cup of coffee.  Robusta, on the other hand, features a bitter taste and, overall, a potent coffee. Central Highlands serves as the ideal ground for growing Robusta beans that feature around 3% of caffeine levels.  Vietnamese people usually add broken ice and sweetened condensed milk to their coffee. Ice dilutes the strength and bitterness while condensed milk creates a sweet taste and creamy texture.  As you know, Vietnamese coffee is everywhere, but still, it\'s not so popular around the world. What is the reason behind it?  Well, Vietnam exports coffee beans to huge corporations that repack and make a cheap instant coffee ready for resale. Basically, Vietnam sells a tremendous amount of coffee beans at a low price to companies like Starbucks or Nestle, that later pack the same coffee in their brands and enjoy massive profits. <h2><strong>How to Prepare Vietnamese Coffee At Home</strong></h2> <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jTbiGpXss7I\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  Whenever you want to prepare a strong and delicious coffee, you have to use \'phin\' - an aluminum filter filled with coffee beans that go on the top of the cup. Once you prepare everything and spill hot water over the coffee, the long preparation process starts. Enjoy watching a drop falling after a drop until your drink is ready.  Vietnamese people don\'t use filter paper while preparing the coffee, which preserves all the essential oils from the beans. That process results in a specific aroma and ultra potency that will kickstart even the worst days. :D  Don\'t be surprised when you take your first sip by the sweetness and creamy texture. People add sweetened condensed milk to their coffee, but you can also order one without if you don\'t prefer so much sugar in your coffee (we will talk about different coffee types). The French colonialists enjoyed coffee with milk so much, but the lack of supply made them bringing the milk to Vietnam.  Since I was living with locals in Nghe An Province (<a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/starlight-english-center-vietnam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">volunteering as an English teacher</a>), coffee drinking was a ritual for us. I\'ve learned to prepare my own coffee using different methods. Here\'s the process of preparing a <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">traditional Vietnamese drip coffee</a>, so you can make one by yourself!  Now when you\'re familiar with the process of making a coffee and its fascinating history, it\'s time to learn more. Check out the most popular coffee types around the country, where to drink it and how much it costs.  <hr />  If you\'re a coffee-lover, like me, believe me, you\'ll spend much time exploring cozy coffee shops around Vietnam. There is something special about the coffee culture and you\'ll get it from the first sight. Locals love their coffee and if you ask a local for a coffee break, there is hardly any chance you\'ll get turned down. <h3 class=\"ql-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>What\'s your favorite coffee type in Vietnam?

(12760, 3, '2020-03-28 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'Hue was the former grand capital of Vietnam, and nowadays, the city radiates with history, culture, and delicious cuisine. Travelers usually follow a regular tourist route exploring the Imperial City, partying at the pub street, and exploring bustling markets near the Perfume River. In my opinion, Hue is a beautiful city, and you can learn a lot about Vietnamese history, but the number of tourist crowds slightly kills the vibe. Looking to explore a bit off-the-beaten-path? Head over to Ho Thuy Tien Abandoned Waterpark in Hue.  Exploring abandoned sites gives me weird goosebumps, partly because of history, partly because of a creepy vibe. Located about 10 km south from the city\'s center, Ho Thuy Tien waterpark was a very bizarre and fascinating experience during our <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/hanoi-to-saigon\">Vietnam motorbike trip</a>. It\'s officially closed to visitors, but money in Vietnam can get you far. We\'ve witnessed pretty creative schemes locals and guards are pulling to extract money from tourists. After a bit of hesitation, and us trying to find a different way through the surrounding forest, we\'ve finally made it to the park.  If you\'re looking to explore Ho Thuy Tien waterpark soon, keep reading our bizarre, but fun experience. <h2><strong>Getting to Ho Thuy Tien Waterpark</strong></h2> Locating the park was the easy part - everyone knows about it, but getting into the park was a tricky one. People share mixed experience while getting in the park, as well as I. I\'ve been exploring the park in 2018. and once in early 2020. The first time, it was a bit tough to get in, but after trying to find another way through the forest, and failing, we managed to bribe a guard (100.000 VND for three people) to get in.  <strong>Arm yourself with knowledge: </strong><a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam\">Avoid these 36 most common scams in Vietnam</a>  The second time wasn\'t possible to get in. We tried to bribe a guard, but nothing worked. One guy who was getting out of the park showed us an alternative way, and the guard spotted us there and started yelling at us. My girlfriend tried to negotiate with him (she is Vietnamese), but the guy started to be aggressive and yelled at her, so we figured out it\'s not our day.  Anyway, I hope you\'re luckier than me, and you\'ll get to the park without the problem.  <em>Here\'s the location of the park on the map, and you can directly set navigation to reach it:</em>  <iframe style=\"border: 0;\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d7654.477531309104!2d107.57792284206744!3d16.412695754673585!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x3141a38bd2c560e3%3A0xe7f19deff74c9e9a!2sThuy%20Tien%20Lake!5e0!3m2!1shr!2shr!4v1585337268310!5m2!1shr!2shr\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" aria-hidden=\"false\"></iframe>  <em>Also, here\'s the screenshot with a detailed explanation:</em>  <img class=\"wp-image-5870 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e7b86c587b8a.jpg\" alt=\"How to get to abandoned waterpark in Hue\" width=\"1256\" height=\"877\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> You\'ll find a security guard on the first entrance who\'s not always happy to let you pass. Alternatively, on the second entrance, you\'ll avoid a security guard but be ready to play mouse and cat.</div>  Get out of the city until reaching Thuy Tien Road. Continue driving until you see a small security outpost. Arm yourself with patience, and don\'t move away if the guard starts yelling at you. Learn how to say a few numbers on Vietnamese, so you can negotiate directly with him. Just be persistent, and he should eventually let you in.  The alternative entrance is an easy bet as there is no security guard there, and you can easily sneak in with your bike. We didn\'t have luck as at the time we sneaked in; the security guy saw us as he was driving around the park.  Once in the park, I\'ve felt a rush of paranoia as you\'re playing cat and mouse with the guard, but after a while, you understand that 50.000 VND can solve every problem. :)  Okay, so now you know how to get in the park, so hopefully, it\'s your lucky day, and you\'ll have a chance to explore the beauty of Ho Thuy Tien waterpark. <h2><strong>Dark History of Ho Thuy Tien Waterpark</strong></h2> <img class=\"wp-image-5886 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e7e4f9bf1fb1.jpg\" alt=\"Reaching the dragon! \" width=\"1130\" height=\"848\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> If you\'re driving a bike, luckily, you can park the bike next to a small local shop overlooking the dragon.</div>  <strong>Why the park is abandoned?</strong>  In short, Ho Thuy Tien waterpark was an <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ho-thuy-tien\">enormous and ambitious project</a> that only partially seen the lights. The park supposed to be the largest waterpark in the region featuring windy slides, a massive lake, thematic parks, swimming pools, and an enormous dragon overlooking the lake. Company Hue Tourism was managing the development, and the budget was set to a whopping $3 billion VND. The developers postponed the opening date time after time, so the local government decided to announce the opening in 2004. while the park was only partially completed.  The park has never seen the full competition, and the developers ran out of the money in 2006. Seven years later, the company named HACO bought the park and planned to create an innovative idea - eco-tourism site. However, it never has seen the light either, and since then, the park stays abandoned.  The story touches the home, like many projects in Croatia, due to budget mismanagement and corruption. Anyway, on our fortune or misfortune, we have a beautiful yet creepy place to discover. <h2><strong>Things to Do Around the Abandoned Waterpark</strong></h2> If you get in by the motorbike, you\'ll have a lot of fun. There is a concrete path leading to the Dragon, but also you can do a nice off-road driving around. It was amusing and refreshing to try our bikes without sharing the road with a thousand people.  Don\'t worry if you forget drinks or snacks as there are sellers in the park where you can get your refreshment. Also, you can park a bike, and these ladies will watch it for you. Be cautious as we heard stories where people got their bikes or parts stolen.  Head over to Dragon that sits in the middle of the lake overlooking the abandoned structures and lush nature. You can climb to the Dragon\'s head and enjoy the view. Be careful as there are much trash, glass, and debris inside the Dragon and around the park. Wear shoes to avoid injuries.  <strong>BE CAREFUL: </strong>Oh, not to forget - some people claim there are crocodiles in the lake. We\'re not sure if that\'s a fairytale or a real story, but here\'s the video from 2014. proving some crocodiles were residing in the park:  <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fQmb8RVDfCA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  <strong>Here are a few photos from the park to give you the feeling of how it looks like:</strong> <p id=\"kOzngyn\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5888 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e7e5044b2bc5.jpg\" alt=\"Random graveyard near abandoned waterpark in Hue\" width=\"1126\" height=\"843\" /></p> <p id=\"zdwzMXr\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5889 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e7e50874fcfc.jpg\" alt=\"Someone is in the dragon! \" width=\"1131\" height=\"848\" /></p> <p id=\"JJiALBA\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5890 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e7e50e84f159.jpg\" alt=\"A tiny and cute car.\" width=\"1127\" height=\"844\" /></p> <p id=\"afJLSxe\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5891 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e7e51535ff92.jpg\" alt=\"Trying to find the head.\" width=\"1126\" height=\"846\" /></p> <p id=\"vjQGyWm\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5892 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e7e51a256973.jpg\" alt=\"And still looking for the head.\" width=\"1126\" height=\"843\" /></p> <p id=\"izuNKhs\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5893 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e7e521dbb498.jpg\" alt=\"Overlooking the lush nature from the head.\" width=\"1128\" height=\"849\" /></p> <p id=\"CZXQqYK\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5894 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e7e5299f1518.jpg\" alt=\"Happy faces on the top. \" width=\"1131\" height=\"846\" /></p> <p id=\"esUZeYl\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5895 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e7e52fe8cc62.jpg\" alt=\"Last views on the dragon.\" width=\"1121\" height=\"842\" /></p> <strong>Bonus one - teachers will know! :D</strong>  <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x_qf7QJBwcs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Have you ever been to the abandoned waterpark in Hue?

(12761, 3, '2020-04-02 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'We\'ve traveled from Hanoi to Saigon and then from Saigon to Hanoi again. There are still so many places you can explore northern from Hanoi (<a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/ha-giang-loop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ha Giang loop</a>) and southern from Saigon, but if you\'re on limited time, this Vietnam motorbike route is perfect for 3 - 4 weeks!  Since we were writing this motorbike itinerary during our first Vietnam trip in 2018., we\'ve completed a few more road trips through Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam. You can find all of these experiences and separate routes through the article.  Keep reading as we\'re going to talk about amazing, stunning, and breathtaking places! I know it will be tough to pick the locations if you have a limited time, as in every place, you\'ll want to stay longer! So let\'s start! :) <h2><strong>Vietnam Motorbike Route &amp; Detailed Map</strong></h2> The map above shows the exact route we took during our motorbike trip. We have a few more stops than usual since we stayed in a small industrial town Cau Giat where Antonio was volunteering as an English teacher. The city features an authentic local lifestyle, deserted beach, lovely hiking trails, and gives you a glimpse of local culture.  Also, we\'ve added a few day trips we did, mainly from central Vietnam.  Check out our epic <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/hanoi-to-saigon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hanoi to Saigon road trip</a> and learn about specific routes, places to visit, accommodation options, budget, and more. <h2><strong>#1- Hanoi</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.hanoi-at-night.jpg\" alt=\"Hanoi at night\" />  For the majority of people, Hanoi is the first destination in Vietnam. It\'s a perfect destination for people who\'re interested in learning as much as possible about the Vietnamese culture or people who decided to travel around Vietnam on a motorbike. The motorbike market is enormous in Hanoi, and the bikes tend to be cheaper to buy than in Saigon. People usually buy their bikes in Hanoi for a lower price and later sell it in Saigon for the same price.  If you\'re not a bike expert, be sure to read our detailed checklist before <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">buying a motorbike in Vietnam</a> to be sure you\'re not driving a crap that will leave you in the middle of nowhere.  Hanoi is a huge city, and it will give you surprising insights into Vietnamese culture. Many people call Hanoi a huge village as it\'s a city with a population of more than 8 million people, but still, the local vibe is very present. You will see locals doing their things, not minding tourists.  Hanoi is a great city to dip yourself into <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-street-food\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vietnamese street food</a>. Also, there are some beautiful places around the city to explore and museums that will educate you about the history and will help you in understanding the people and culture.  People usually spend around 4 - 5 days exploring the city\'s attractions and cuisine. After you\'re done with Hanoi, there are a few ways to continue your trip. One is going on the north exploring Sapa and driving a northern loop, and the other is to visit stunning Halong Bay that is just on the corner!  <strong>More on Hanoi:</strong> <ul>   <li><a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/2-days-in-hanoi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">48 hours in Hanoi itinerary </a></li>   <li><a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/things-to-do-in-hanoi-at-night\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Awesome Things to do in Hanoi at night</a></li>   <li><a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/street-food-in-hanoi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8 Street Food Dishes You Have to Try in Hanoi!</a></li> </ul> <h2><strong>#2- Halong Bay</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.halong-bay.jpg\" alt=\"stunning Ha Long bay\" />  If you\'re lacking time to ride a northern loop, but you want to experience the magic of the north, then head to stunning Halong Bay. The place is one of the natural worlds wonders as the bay is the home of more than 1000 limestone islands. My advice is to get a motorbike there (rents are very cheap, and the average price is around 100,000 VND per day) as you will have total freedom while exploring the place.  The other option, which is a bit more expensive, is booking a boat tour around the islands. The tours usually last for a night, and you will have a chance to experience one of the most secluded beaches around the bay.  For hiking lovers, don\'t forget to check out the <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/halong-bay-vietnam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bai Tho Mountain</a> in the center of the city. The hike is not so challenging, and it takes only around 45 minutes to get to the top, but the views over a whole bay are merely breathtaking and worth the struggle of getting up! <h2><strong>#3- Ninh Binh (Tam Coc &amp; Trang An)</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.ninh-binh.jpg\" alt=\"Top of Mua Cave in Tam Coc\" />  For people who enjoy nature and infinite drives around stunning views, the Ninh Binh area is the perfect spot. Ninh Binh area, especially Tam Coc and Trang An are usually called Halong Bay on earth. The reason for the name is that the place is a home of hundreds of limestones in the middle rice paddies.  It\'s awe-inspiring as you can explore the place with a bicycle or motorbike without paying a massive price for a boat tour, and also you\'re free while driving and exploring around. The area has many attractions, but also many hidden places where you can just lose yourself in the beauty the area offers. If you\'re an adventurous soul like me, don\'t forget to bring a tent and camping equipment.  Also, simple picnic equipment and food near the river in the middle of the rice fields will give you an unforgettable experience in this beautiful place. My advice is to rent a motorbike and check out some of the <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-temples-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">greatest Vietnam temples</a>, try some delicious food (their goat dishes are more than delicious!), take a boat tour through the caves and then just relax in the middle of the rice fields while wandering the stunning views around countless limestones! <h2><strong>#4- Phong Nha</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.phong-nha.jpg\" alt=\"Curvy road in Phong Nha\" />  Heading south from Ninh Binh is a bit monotone route as it gives you only the experience of the rural countryside. Don\'t get me wrong, I think everyone should experience the countryside and interact with beautiful people there. If you\'re on limited time and you want to explore most of Vietnam, then I advise you to head over to Phong Nha.  This part of the country is a bit laid down, but tourism is popping out like crazy in the town. This place is the home of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_S%C6%A1n_%C4%90o%C3%B2ng\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">biggest cave in the world</a> with a whole ecosystem, but it\'s accessible only to people who have permits and equipment that costs about $5,000. Anyway, the place has stunning scenery, and a vast national park is just around the corner.  The national park is the home of the Paradise cave and many windy roads overlooking the limestones, rivers, and lively countryside. We stayed two days in Phong Nha, but we\'d like to spend at least a week there as the scenery and a laid-back life recharge your energy for the trip ahead. Also, not to forget, the road to Phong Nha is terrific, but a bit challenging as you\'re going inland heading to Laos border.  The road you\'ll be probably taking is an infamous Ho Chi Minh Road, which leads you through stunning scenery. It will take you a lot of time as you will probably stop so many times to admire the view and take a picture or two! <h2><strong>#5- Hue</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.imperial-city-hue.jpg\" alt=\"Imperial city of Hue\" />  Hue is an imperial city of Vietnam that was once a capital during the reign of the Nguyen dynasty. The city was in ruins during the Vietnam war, but locals and international investments helped the city to get on feet again. Hue radiates with a beautiful vibe, especially during the night, but it is a bit touristic, and the prices are set accordingly to tourists.  I advise you to visit an imperial city. Do it in the morning since it can take a few hours to walk around it. It\'s a massive complex with a lot of information that will give you great insights into that part of history. The entrance ticket costs 150,000 VND.  Another great place around Hue is the <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/abandoned-waterpark-hue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ho Thuy Tien abandoned water park</a> that is located on the skirts of the city.  <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.abandoned-park-in-hue.jpg\" alt=\"Abandoned park in Hue\" />  The place is so beautiful, and you will get that vibe instantly when you get there. Sometimes it can be tough to get there as there is a security guy on the doors, and he will act like there is no way to enter, but just give him a bit of money, and he will let you in with a wide smile on his face. Also, inside the park, there is a local lady selling beverages and many people exploring the place each day, so the place doesn\'t look abandoned at all. It was my favorite place in and around Hue. <h2><strong>#6- Da Nang</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.my-khe-beach.jpg\" alt=\"My Khe beach in Da Nang\" />  Da Nang is by far my favorite city in the whole of Vietnam (I\'ve been living in Da Nang for almost a year), if not in a whole SEA. The city lies on the coast, and I usually call it \'Vietnamese Miami\'.  I would say that the city has a perfect balance of nature and cool things to explore and do. There are many mountains, stunning beaches, scenic roads that can be found just on the skirts of the city. When you\'re in the city, don\'t forget to check the Marble Mountain, <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/son-tra-peninsula\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Son Tra Peninsula</a> and also, rent a bike to drive through an iconic Hai Van Pass.  The food is fantastic there, and it differs a bit from the northern cuisine, so don\'t forget to try their specialty called Mi Quang and Bun Bo Hue. If you find yourself in the city during the weekend, head over to Dragon Bridge at 9 pm to see a fire-spitting show there.  Coffee culture is a massive part of daily life in Da Nang for locals and expats. Coffee is always potent and delicious, so it will keep you awake and alert. If you\'re coming to Da Nang to work or relax, check out the <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/working-cafes-in-da-nang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">best working cafes in Da Nang</a>.  <strong>More on Da Nang:</strong> <ul>   <li><a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/best-time-to-visit-da-nang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Best Time to Visit Da Nang?</a></li>   <li><a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/living-in-da-nang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cost of Living in Da Nang (Jan.2020)</a></li>   <li><a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/3-days-in-da-nang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3 Days in Da Nang - Things to Do, What to Eat &amp; Where to Stay?</a></li> </ul> <h2><strong>#7- Hoi An</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.hoi-an.jpg\" alt=\"Hoi An ancient town\" />  Hoi An is a small town with the old town core that was built during French colonization, so it looks like a small French village. It sounds lovely, but if you\'re not ready for being in an overcrowded little town, then maybe you won\'t enjoy the city. It is a magical city during the night as countless lanterns, and many boats are floating on rivers around.  Hoi An is usually called \'Vietnamese Venice\' as many small islands and rivers are crossing and dividing the town. Try out their food market for a delicious specialty, and don\'t forget to try their Mi Xao - fried noodles with many spices and vegetables. Hoi An is just about 30 km south of Da Nang, and it has many homestays and hostels in the middle of the rice fields.  It\'s a perfect way to relax and recharge your batteries for the trip that is in front of you since you might take an inland route, which is very challenging at times. <h2><strong>#8- Kon Tum</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.kon-tum-bridge.jpg\" alt=\"Kong Lor Bridge in Kontum\" />  Not many tourists visit Kon Tum, but it\'s one of my highlights in the whole of Vietnam! It\'s a city located in the middle of the Highlands and you can get there from Hoi An. The distance is around 300 km, but the trip can last a whole day since you\'re driving through scenic windy and mountainous roads and the weather conditions are totally unpredictable at times.  Prepare yourself for a trip by getting enough food and extra gas in the bottles as there are parts on the road where there is not a single sign of any civilization. The trail is beautiful as you will stumble stunning mountains, windy roads, random rivers and lakes, and few waterfalls that pop up out of nowhere.  The city itself is impressive as it\'s a home of many ethnic groups, and you don\'t need any extra permits to get there. We were just sitting in the countryside and observing the lifestyle of the ethnic people. These people are thrilled and very welcoming to foreigners. Also, a few museums are showing the history of Kon Tum and ethnic groups in Vietnam.  After a whole day of exploration, check out the food market in the city center to get some delicious soup and glass of their famous Che (bean cream)! Also, don\'t forget to try their coffee as once you get to the highlands, you will notice coffee fields all around. Coffee has a different taste than in the north, any, in my opinion, is by far more delicious and higher quality.  The majority of Vietnamese coffee is Robusta, but around Kon Tum, and Highlands in general, there are a lot of Arabica beans. If you\'re looking for an <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">authentic traditional Vietnamese coffee</a>, Kon Tum is the place to be. <h2><strong>#9- Qui Nhon</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.quy-nhon.jpg\" alt=\"Qui Nhon from Top\" />  Some people might be overwhelmed by the countryside and mountains, and they miss the beach vibe. If that\'s the case with you, then head over to coast again to a coastal city Qui Nhon. It\'s a fascinating city that has similarities to Da Nang but without tourist crowds. A perfect place to chill for a few days to recoup the energy. The city is becoming more and more popular as you will see resorts are popping out each month.  The beaches around the place are so amazing, and also, there is a desert island with so many sandy beaches and fisherman villages around. Few places around the city are perfect for hiking as while you reach the top, breathtaking looks over the whole city will award you.  A pretty laid back city with not so many things to do except relaxing on the beach, eating delicious seafood, and enjoying a cup of Vietnamese coffee. <h2><strong>#10- Nha Trang</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.nha-trang-local-part.jpg\" alt=\"Local part of Nha Trang\" />  The next awesome city that is stretching along the southern coast is called Nha Trang. It is a fantastic city if you\'re looking for wild nightlife and partying at the beach, but also, the place is surrounded by a surreal landscape featuring many islands, peninsulas, and stunning roads. Don\'t forget to try their iconic seafood!  If you\'re looking for a fantastic adventure, then do <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/snorkeling-in-nha-trang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">snorkeling in Nha Trang</a>. There are a few natural heavens for divers, and it\'s a thing to do once in Nha Trang. <h2><strong>#11- Buon Ma Thuot</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.bmt.jpg\" alt=\"Mountains around Buon Ma Thuot\" />  Are you a coffee addict? Believe me, <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-coffee-culture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vietnamese coffee</a> is one of the most delicious and most potent coffees I had a chance to try. Buon Ma Thuot is a city of Central Highlands, and its second name is \'the capital of coffee in Vietnam\'. The city didn\'t get the name by accident!  The coffee is terrific there as this area is one of the biggest coffee producers in the whole of Vietnam.  The city itself doesn\'t have many exciting things to do except stunning landscape, ultra-delicious coffee, and fantastic food at night. Coffee lovers should check out this city as there is a vast selection of beans, and also, you can learn so many things about the coffee and way of preparation there. <h2><strong>#12- Da Lat</strong></h2> <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jTbiGpXss7I\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  Ah, that Da Lat! When you talk with locals and ask them about their favorite place in Vietnam, the majority of them will tell you about Da Lat.  The city is located in the middle of the mountains and with few lakes in the center of the city, it looks very peaceful. The coffee is also very amazing there, and you can find many places with stunning views to enjoy your coffee in Da Lat. Also, traditional Vietnamese food and Korean food are trendy in Da Lat, so foodie lovers will enjoy it.  The city is called \'the city of the eternal spring\' as the weather is chilly during the whole year. During the day, it\'s charming weather, but in the mornings and during the night, the temperatures will be lower. Don\'t go there without long sleeves as you\'ll be freezing like me. :) <h2><strong>#13- Mui Ne/Phan Thiet</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.mui-ne.jpg\" alt=\"Beach in Mui Ne\" />  Mui Ne is a small place that set its borders on the southern coast of Vietnam, around 200 km away from Saigon (HCMC). If you\'re looking for partying with locals and foreigners, that\'s the place you want to head! Also, there are many cheap options when it comes to resorts and bungalows for people who want to relax a bit.  The town is widely known for its huge waves and perfect winds, which attract thousands of surfers and windsurfers. You can learn to surf or windsurf there for a very affordable price. Also, don\'t forget to try their seafood, especially in a local restaurant. The place is filled with massage shops, so if you\'re driving a motorbike, believe me, you will need a message here and there.  If you\'re coming from Nha Trang, be sure that you visit a small city called Phan Rang. The food is authentic, and the city is known as the capital of kitesurfing in Vietnam. Check out our experience while <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/phan-rang-kitesurfing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">kitesurfing in Phan Rang</a> to get a better idea of the place.  They have a vast selection of massages, so it\'s up to you to choose the one you prefer the most. Also, the place is the home of Red and White sand dunes. Literally, this place is set in the middle of the desert, and it\'s very stunning to visit.  Be careful if you\'re riding a motorbike as there is a known police blockade between Red and White dunes, and they are targeting foreigners to get the bribes that are usually not small. Always ask travelers who\'re around the area about the police situation and learn <a href=\"http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-police-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how to deal with Vietnamese police</a>. <h2><strong>#14- Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon)</strong></h2> <img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.saigon-at-night.jpg\" alt=\"Reaching Saigon was the end of our motorbike trip in Vietnam\" />  Saigon or Ho Chi Minh City is the biggest city in Vietnam with whooping 10 million people living in. The city is very modern and doesn\'t look like any other city in Vietnam. Saigon is the economic capital of Vietnam, and the city is very developed in some parts. However, there are many places where you can experience local Vietnamese culture.  Ho Chi Minh City features a wild nightlife and excellent living standards, especially for expats. The traffic is exceptionally crazy there, so be extra careful when riding a motorbike as there are millions of motorcycles around. The good thing to visit there is a War Remnants Museum that will teach you so much about the history of war and will give you a good knowledge of the people and culture today.  Be aware as the museum presents very vivid pictures and scenes, and you will feel the emotion. I personally didn\'t like Saigon so much, so I can\'t tell you more about it since I\'ve stayed for only 2 days and start my journey to the north one more time.  <hr />  Exploring Vietnam by a motorbike was by far one of our best and most bonding experience so far. If you\'re planning to visit Vietnam anytime soon, and have at least 3 weeks, don\'t hesitate and explore the country by bike.  You can use our Vietnam motorbike route when planning your own itinerary, or you can simply add or remove some places from the route. If you have more time, we really suggest exploring West Ho Chi Minh Road! <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Don\'t hesitate to share your experiences and motorbike routes you\'ve taken.</h3>', 'Balanced Vietnam Motorbike Route For First-Timers', 'TODO: Write Excerpt\r\n', 'draft', 'open', 'open', '', '', '', '', '2020-04-02 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', 0, 'http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/?p=12761', 0, 'post', '', 0);

(12762, 2, '2020-04-04 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'While Battambang is the third-largest city in Cambodia, it is a very sleepy and tranquil city compared to what you may experience in Vietnam. The surroundings of the city are immensely beautiful, as just a short ride out from the city, you will marvel at amazing sights of green rice paddies stretching out on the horizon. More often than not, these rice paddies are towered upon by limestone hills, each one of them has its own story of how it came to be. Today, we will focus on the Phom Sampeau, which is the perfect example of how Cambodia is sometimes a land of contradictions. You will explore the recent bloody history of this area in the Killing Caves, while being amazed at how nature has regained its grasp over here, on this short day trip from Battambang,  So, without further ado, let\'s learn something about the Phnom Sampeau, and why should you visit this amazing site while you\'re in Battambang! <h2><strong>More About Phnom Sampeau</strong></h2> <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5964\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.phnom-sampeau.jpg\" alt=\"Phnom Sampeau certainly resembles a ship.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Phnom Sampeau certainly resembles a ship.</em></div>  Phnom Sampeau is a limestone hill that has numerous caves to explore. You can instantly recognize it for the golden temple on top of it, that you can see from the distance.  We would love to delve into the folklore of this amazing landmark. First, from the terminology perspective, we can split the name of this hill into two pieces: <ul>   <li><em>Phnom </em>means hill</li>   <li><em>Sampeau </em>means ship</li> </ul> Now, there is one short and cryptic legend that connects to the creation of this hill, and how it got its name. This is the legend of Princess Neang Rumsay Sok. The legend goes that the titular princess was rejected by her love, Prince Reach Kol. He rejected her because he went on to fight a huge crocodile, Athun; who was terrorizing the land. The Prince was swallowed by the crocodile, and when all hope seemed to be lost, the Princess dropped her hair down in the water. Her hair dried the water down, which petrified the crocodile. Athun has essentially become a limestone hill, Phnom Sampeau.  Well, the legend surrounding this place is certainly interesting, and the site itself continues this tradition! <h2>How To Get to Phnom Sampeau</h2> Getting to Phnom Sampeau is easy enough, especially if you have mobile data on your phone. It\'s just a <strong>15-kilometer ride southwest of Battambang</strong>, and the road to there is hard to miss. Just connect to Road 57, and you will see the hill with a golden pagoda in the distance. May that be your main piece of orientation.  <em>Here is the map slice to show you how to get there from Battambang!</em> <p id=\"qHkNhpU\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-5900 size-full\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e7e64b3af388.jpg\" alt=\"The route from Battambang to Phnom Sampeau is pretty straightforward; if you stick to the main road!\" width=\"1149\" height=\"760\" /></p> As you can see, the route from Battambang to Phnom Sampeau is pretty straightforward; if you stick to the main road! Of course, being passionate adventurers, we didn\'t go there by this route. When we were doing a day trip from Battambang to Phnom Sampeau and its Killing Caves; we first wanted to see Phnom Banan, a ruined temple to the south of Phnom Sampeau. It is also located on the limestone hill, but getting from there to Phnom Sampeau isn\'t so straightforward.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5901\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.phnom-sampeau-alternate-route.jpg\" alt=\"The alternate route to Phnom Sampeau.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>The alternate route to Phnom Sampeau.</em></div>  In the end, we ended up splitting up in two groups and riding on the muddy dirt road tracks to avoid paying for the entrance fee. Albeit it took us a while to get to the hill, it sure is an amazing experience riding with 115cc scooters on a muddy path. Not to mention the view on the Phnom Sampov hill, with the golden pagoda on the top, which is simply breathtaking. Sometimes, straying off from the planned path rewards you immensely!  <img class=\"wp-image-5902 size-large\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.phnom-sampeau-pagoda.jpg\" alt=\"Phnom Sampeau is distinctive enough by its golden pagoda at the top.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Phnom Sampeau is distinctive enough by its golden pagoda at the top.</em></div>  Once you get to the bottom of the hill, you will encounter a small village that seems like it was transformed by the tourism potential of this area; both for nature and history tourism alike. Lots of people come to gather here before dusk to see the bats burst out from the Bat Cave, but more on that later.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5969\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.phnom-sampeau-village.jpg\" alt=\"The village below Phnom Sampeau.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>The village below Phnom Sampeau.</em></div>  One thing to keep in mind is that if you prefer to go through the bumpy road up Phnom Sampeau, you will need to go to the nearby \"tourism office\" and pay <strong>2 USD for the passage</strong> by the guardhouse at the bottom of the hill. Also, behind this office, there are 700 steep steps that you can take instead to the top of the hill. We took the road route, as we were pretty low on time, thanks to our previous endeavor!  <strong>Note: </strong><em>if you don\'t have a motorbike, go with tuk-tuk from Battambang to Phnom Sampeau, and you can ask for a motorbike driver to ride you to the top and back for 1 USD, as tuk-tuks are not allowed on the road to the top. Not that you would actually make it up the steep road to the top.</em>  The first station of this day trip from Battambang are the Killing Caves, so prepare for a pretty unsettling, yet very important history lesson! <h2><strong>The Killing Caves of Battambang</strong></h2> <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5953\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.killing-caves-battambang.jpg\" alt=\"The Killing Caves of Battambang - both the place of grim tragedy, and natural wonder.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>The Killing Caves of Battambang - both the place of a grim tragedy, and a natural wonder.</em></div>  Just 250 meters up the road, you will locate this infamous Khmer Rouge execution site. Here, the Khmer Rouge regime committed horrifying acts of violence on the Cambodian people. Local estimates tell us that some <strong>10,000 people lost their lives at this spot</strong> during the regime. We don\'t want to delve deep on the Khmer Rouge regime and its impact on Cambodia here, but here is a post <strong><a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/the-khmer-rouge\">about Khmer Rouge </a></strong>if you want to learn more.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5955\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.killling-caves-entrance.jpg\" alt=\"The entrance to the Killing Caves.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>The entrance to the Killing Caves.</em></div>  <strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>if you are horrified by depictions of cruelty and violence, then we suggest that you move to the next section. In the next few paragraphs, we will show the exterior and the interior of the Killing Caves of Battambang; where you can also see the skulls of the victims. We show this content with the utmost respect for the victims of the Khmer Rouge regime.</em>  Just as you enter the site, you will see a few Buddhist shrines and the amazing viewpoints on the land below the hill. Near the Killing Caves, you will see statues that show atrocities done on people on this site. One cannot imagine that all of this happened a bit more than 40 years ago!  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5956\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.khmer-rouge-torture.jpg\" alt=\"Statues depicting Khmer Rouge torture methods.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Statues depicting Khmer Rouge torture methods.</em></div>  You can see a daylight shaft at the entrance of the caves. Khmer Rouge soldiers would round up people in front of this spot, then bludgeon them to death, and throw them into the abyss below. The caves eventually filled up with corpses, so the new victims actually didn\'t die of the impact. They would starve to death after some time. Khmer Rouge actually used separate caves for adult and children executions.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5958\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.killing-cave-entrance.jpg\" alt=\"The stairs leading to the Killing Caves.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>The stairs leading to the Killing Caves.</em></div>  Take the Naga stairs down into the cave and you will find a memorial site inside. There is a Reclining Buddha statue inside and a memorial glass with the skulls of the victims inside, as a sign of respect. Many Cambodian local people come here to pay their respects to the dead, as this is also a popular place of pilgrimage.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5962\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.reclining-buddha.jpg\" alt=\"The reclining Buddha statue.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>The reclining Buddha statue.</em></div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5963\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.killing-caves-skulls.jpg\" alt=\"The skulls of the Killing Caves victims.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>The skulls of the Killing Caves victims.</em></div>  <strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>Remove your shoes when you enter the memorial site inside the cave to show respect to the local customs and victims.</em>  During the late afternoon, someone will usually ring the bell in one of the shrines nearby to signalize that it is time to go. After all, those who are not with us need their peace, it is said.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5957\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.killing-caves-viewpoint.jpg\" alt=\"The amazing view from the Killing Caves.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>The amazing view from the Killing Caves.</em></div>  Well, visiting this place was really a punch in the gut. It is a place of a grim tragedy that is reclaimed back by nature. At this site of many atrocities, you are surrounded by wonderful viewpoints on the greenery below. This evokes feelings of both disgust and awe, which is a true contradiction; a thing I mentioned at the beginning of the post. After all, Cambodians believe that joy is the best way to move past tragedy. We must say that they are doing pretty well with that.  After an educative transportation to the grim history of Cambodia, let\'s explore some caves in Phnom Sampeau! <h2><strong>Pkar Slar Cave</strong></h2> <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5946\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.pkar-slar-cave.jpg\" alt=\"Come during the right light conditions, and Pkar Slar cave will amaze you!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Come during the right light conditions, and Pkar Slar cave will amaze you!</em></div>  After you leave the Killing Caves, continue up the road and park near the summit of the hill. There are cave grounds, filled with stalls, and a group of sneaky and cute group of macaques!  Pkar Slar cave is very small, albeit it has a specific atmosphere due to the Buddhist shrine inside. When we were exploring the cave, there was a lovely scene in front of our eyes. A woman was meditating in front of the Buddha statue, and the sun rays burst through the cave opening.  Also, you will notice many <em>\"tour guides\"</em> who will guide you for a minute or two through the cave and ask you for money. We say that you help them out with a small tip.  Now it\'s time to get to the top of the hill! <h2><strong>Wat Sampeau</strong></h2> <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5947\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.wat-sampeau.jpg\" alt=\"Wat Sampeau, the golden temple.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Wat Sampeau, the golden temple.</em></div>  Near the Pkar Slar cave grounds, you can take the steps to the temple grounds located at the top of Phnom Sampeau. The number of macaques will drastically rise up, and it is fun to observe what this funny bunch is up to! These temple grounds offer a very zen atmosphere, with Buddhist monks praying and looking for offerings, locals giving offerings, and lots of amazing and mysterious architecture.  If you are interested in learning more about temples in this region, here is a lovely read on <strong><a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-temples-guide\">temples in Vietnam</a></strong>!  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5948\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.macaque.jpg\" alt=\"This macaque is up to no good!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>This macaque is up to no good!</em></div>  We also saw a lot of kids role-playing swordsmen with wooden swords. They were bro-fisting us all the time! It was good to be on their good side, and not to feel the wrath of the swordsmen!  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5949\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.swordsmen.jpg\" alt=\"Little swordsmen in the flow of their training.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Little swordsmen in the flow of their training.</em></div>  Of course, all over the temple grounds, you can buy water and snacks (oh almost forgot, there is beer too!). The tourism in this area is slowly developing, but it is still off the radar for most foreigners for now.  One local at the water stall offered us to show a viewpoint for 30 USD. We politely declined as we knew that we are clever enough to find it on our own. There is one pathway at which you will see a small passage through the bush, that leads to a ladder.

And last but not least, we will also share our experience of riding from Siem Reap to Battambang with a motorbike!

We researched several transport options that you can take from Siem Reap to Battambang or reverse.  First, we have the bus. It is definitely the most convenient option, as it is cheap (<strong>around 8 USD for a one-way ticket</strong>), and the journey takes between 3 to 4 hours.  Then, we have the taxi. Well, it is certainly a more comfortable and faster experience than the bus and it is ideal if you are traveling in a group. Expect to pay <strong>around 50 USD for a one-way trip</strong> and to travel around two to two and a half hours.  If you opt for a more unique journey from Siem Reap to Battambang or reverse, don\'t hesitate to book a ferry! The ferry will provide a unique experience, as you will discover another side to the local lifestyle of Cambodia. Just keep in mind that the ferry ride won\'t be really comfortable and that it will take a while. The ferry trip takes between six to eight hours and <strong>costs 25 USD</strong>.  Well, without further ado, let\'s dive into the different possibilities of getting from Siem Reap to Cambodia (or reverse). <h2>Buses from Siem Reap to Battambang (or reverse)</h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5998\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.mekong-express-bus.jpg\" alt=\"Mekong Express bus.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />  We have two types of buses operating from Siem Reap to Battambang, the regular and VIP buses (buses and minibusses). The regular buses usually cost around 4 USD. They are 50-seater buses and can be quite uncomfortable, especially if you are very tall. Their <strong>journey time is around 4 hours</strong>, with toilet and snack break included. For more information on regular buses operating from Siem Reap to Battambang, check local bus stations or with your accommodation for tickets and timetables.  VIP buses (or minibusses) are <strong>quicker than regular buses</strong> as they don\'t stop that often. If you really need a toilet break, you can ask the driver to stop and take a short break. Their price is from 6 USD to 8 USD. Also, VIP buses are 18-seated or 25-seated.  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> Most bus companies operating from Siem Reap to Battambang (or reverse) will advertise Wi-Fi on their buses. In most cases, the connection is very slow, so you will be better off with mobile data instead!</div>  If you take a bus, it is a bit longer journey, as all buses will pass via Sisophon, so that makes the journey distance of 211 km.  Let\'s go into more detail about your options when it comes to buses and minibusses on this relation!  <strong>Regular Bus</strong>  Take care, as there are quite a few shady bus companies that ride on this route. We highly recommend you to <strong>book Mekong Express or Capitol Tours</strong> if you opt for a bus journey. Let\'s talk a bit about Capitol Tours, as we will detail Mekong Express in the <em>Minibus</em> section. Yes, they have regular and VIP buses!  Capitol Tours, with its 42-seater buses, has quite a positive reputation in the public transport market. The journey with this company will take around three hours, and the <strong>ticket price is 5,50 USD</strong>. One big disadvantage with Capitol Tours is that you cannot book their tickets online, so you will need to go directly to their office to book the tickets.

Currently, the roads are pretty rough, especially on the second half of the route to Battambang, as there are roadworks about.  For the end, here is the schedule of the Mekong Express buses: <table class=\'mekong_express_schedule\'>         <tr>                 <th>Route</td>                 <th>Departure Times</td>         </tr>         <tr>                 <td>Siem Reap to Battambang</td>                 <td>8 AM, 9 AM, 1.35 PM, 2 PM, 3 PM</td>         </tr>         <tr>                 <td>Battambang to Siem Reap</td>                 <td>8 AM, 9 AM, 1.35 PM, 2 PM, 3 PM</td>         </tr> </table> <h2>Taxi from Siem Reap to Battambang (or reverse)</h2> <img class=\"size-full wp-image-5999 aligncenter\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.taxi-to-battambang.jpg\" alt=\"Taxi from Siem Reap to Battambang.\" width=\"850\" height=\"567\" />  The taxi on this relation is the best option if you want a comfortable ride to Battambang or reverse, with some nice scenery on the route. It is probably the <strong>best option if you are traveling in a group</strong>.  The taxi vehicle that drives in this direction is usually Toyota Camry, which can fit 4 passengers. We suggest that you travel with less luggage if you are in a group of 3+ people, as the car trunk will be filled most of the time. On the road, you can stop for a toilet or coffee break, and even go sightseeing if you agree with your driver.  The journey on this relation with taxi <strong>costs around 50 USD</strong>. Make sure to agree on the price and on the location where you want to be dropped off before the ride itself!  Where can you hire a taxi for this relation? First of all, you can check around your accommodation, or ask a travel agent. The most convenient way is to book a taxi online via <a href=\"https://bookmebus.com/search/private_taxi/siem-reap/battambang\"><strong>BookMeBus</strong></a>, or <a href=\"https://www.camboticket.com/taxi-tickets/siem-reap/battambang\"><strong>Camboticket</strong></a>.  When you book via BookMeBus, you can book a van which is the most comfortable taxi ride you can get on this relation. It <strong>costs 90 USD</strong>, and you will essentially get into a van with 11 seats.  If you book online via Camboticket, you can <strong>hire a taxi for 55 USD</strong>, which is also a bit more comfortable than your usual Toyota Camry taxi.  The taxi ride from Siem Reap to Battambang (or reverse) will take <strong>around two to two and a half hours</strong>, depending on the road conditions, weather conditions, traffic, and how many breaks you take. One thing is certain - you can expect a very comfortable ride! <h2>Boat from Siem Reap to Battambang (or reverse)</h2> <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6000\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.siem-reap-ferry.jpg\" alt=\"Ferry from Siem Reap.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" />  You can take a ferry from Siem Reap to Battambang or reverse, with boats departing as early as 7.30 AM. For specific departure times, check with your accommodation to get a better insight.  The boat journey will take you any time <strong>between six to eight hours</strong>. That depends on the water levels and on the weather season. You see, during the dry season (between April and June), the water levels in Tonle Sap lake are too low for a ferry ride. The best time to take a boat ride on this relation is during the wet season (from July to March), as the water levels in Tonle Sap will be enough for a boat ride.   Why should you take a ferry from Siem Reap to Battambang? Well, for starters, this is a nice way of getting to Battambang or reverse if you really want to get a feel of local culture. You will sail on Tonle Sap, which means through many floating fishing villages. This could result in a very distinct experience in this region.  Keep in mind that the <strong>boats aren\'t the safest transportation option!</strong> All the ferries that take this route are local-made, wooden boats, that aren\'t the most comfortable. It tends to be quite hot and you can hear the engine of the boat at all times. If you can sit through all that, you will be rewarded with an off the beaten track route without tourist crowds.  We can\'t stress this enough, but if you want to avoid getting sunburned, make sure to bring sunscreen! With that, you should take some rain protection gear, as it tends to rain often in this part of Cambodia. You can buy raincoats for 2,000 Cambodian Riel (around 0,50 USD) at almost any small streetside shop.  The boat tickets <strong>cost 25 USD</strong> in either direction for one person. You can book tickets on the same day of the journey at the port. At some rare occasions, you can book a ferry ticket online <a href=\"https://bookmebus.com/en/search/ferry/siem-reap/battambang\"><strong>here.</strong> </a>  <div class=\'single_post_info_box\'> If you want an elite experience, it is possible to book the whole boat for 180 USD!</div>  The ferry from Siem Reap departs from Phnom Krom Port. To get there, hop on a tik-tuk for around 5 USD that can take you directly to Phnom Krom!  What to say else other than to enjoy the ferry ride on the majestic Tonle Sap! <h2>Siem Reap to Battambang with Motorbike</h2> Last but not least, we want to share with you our experience of the route from Siem Reap to Battambang, which we conquered with motorbikes. To be more specific, 3 Yamaha automatic bikes, and one Honda Wave - with tons of luggage on every bike. The journey <strong>took us 5 hours</strong>, with lots of breaks in between, changing from early afternoon, to the darkness of the night.  <em>Here is the route that we took:</em>  <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5984\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.siem-reap-to-battambang-motorbike-route.jpg\" alt=\"Siem Reap to Battambang Motorbike Route\" width=\"1024\" height=\"657\" />  On the first half of the route, we are following Route 6 from Siem Reap to Sisophon, where we connect to the harrowing Route 5 and continue on to Battambang. There is a 104 km distance from Siem Reap to Sisophon and 69 km distance from Sisophon to Battambang.  The beginning section of Route 6 after leaving Siem Reap is full of potholes, and loads of trucks and cars that force you to hug the far right side of the road. As we traveled around Cambodia during the wet season, we were met with lots of sunshine and lots of random showers that force you to put on the raincoats and ride further.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5986\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.road-from-siem-reap.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>The beginning of the road from Siem Reap to Battambang.</em></div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5987\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.road-to-battambang.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Rare sight of a beautiful road section en route to Battambang, with rainstorm following us from behind.</em></div>  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5985\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.truck-cambodian-roads.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Slapped by the remains of the rain from the truck!</em></div>  There are some amazing curvy sections on Route 6 with amazing scenery.

We were lucky to find a mechanic besides the road who fixed this problem for the short term period. It was a lovely, friendly bunch for sure!  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5992\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.mechanic-shop-cambodia.jpg\" alt=\"Mechanic and his apprentices.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Mechanic and his apprentices.</em></div>  After fixing the exhaust on the Honda Wave, we blazed through the villages to Sisophon. Then, we hit the harrowing Route 5 to Battambang, unaware of the road works that awaited us further down the road. This road was crazy at the time of the ride. Unpaved? Check. Road holes? Check. Massively aggressive truck drivers? Check.  Everything was down on the board, and we continued through this chaos. We had a lot of near-misses with the trucks, as the driveable unpaved section of the road was very narrow for both bikes and trucks together on one lane. Also, lots of dust was produced by speedy truck drivers, and the visibility was poor.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5994\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.unpaved-road-to-battambang.jpg\" alt=\"The Route 5 in all its dusty glory.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Route 5 in all its dusty glory.</em></div>  At one point, David got stung by a wasp in the arm, which forced us to take a small break near the sticky rice (called Kralan in Cambodia) stall. Kralan is a delicious snack served in bamboo sticks that is prevalent around Southeast Asia.  <img class=\"size-large wp-image-5993\" src=\"http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.sticky-rice-kralan-stall.jpg\" alt=\"Sticky rice snacks got our smiles up!\" width=\"1024\" height=\"685\" /><div class=\'image_description\'> <em>Sticky rice snacks got our smiles up!</em></div>  After devouring a few Kralan portions, the nighttime came with its challenges. During the nighttime, the visibility falters, as it is really rare to see light other than our bike headlights and an occasional truck driver.  After riding for a while, we finally got to Battambang. It was an exhilarating and challenging ride to be certain! We love rewarding rides like these! This is what makes us so in love with motorbike trips around this amazing part of our world.  <em>If you want to see how this journey looks like in motion, here is a video that we recorded on this route!</em>  <iframe width=\"764\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqjWv_tgTq4&amp;t\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  <hr />  Now that you know how to get from Siem Reap to Battambang (or reverse), we invite you to explore these two amazing locales. Of course, Siem Reap is world-famous for the Angkor Wat temple complex, but there is a certain charm to the city itself. And not to forget, the ride to Tonle Sap lake is absolutely breathtaking, and you definitely shouldn\'t miss that!  Battambang is a more tranquil place than Siem Reap and a very vibey city. Here is a <a href=\"https://vietnamchronicles.com/killing-caves-battambang\"><strong>day trip from Battambang</strong> </a>that you shouldn\'t miss while being there!

He has been volunteering on different projects and traveling around the country with the motorbike for the last 9 months and he’s going to share bits of the knowledge with you when it comes to volunteering in Vietnam. So, you’ve decided to volunteer in Vietnam? That’s awesome, but depending on your current country, it’s not a small step since you need to be ready for many sacrifices and a complete change in your lifestyle. Once you’ve got the idea of volunteering in a foreign country, don’t immediately rush to it, but let it stay for a while. Think about it and do the research constantly. If the idea still stays with you after a few months, then volunteering is probably a thing you should do. In this article, I’m going to write about the things you should know before deciding to volunteer in Vietnam. <b>Note: </b>Regulations and laws are constantly changing in Vietnam, so always be sure that you checked everything with your embassy before going to Vietnam. The last thing you want is to be deported from the country where you just wanted to help local community. Believe me, it can happen and it happened to many people before!\n\n<b>Questions to Ask Yourself Before Volunteering in Vietnam</b> Alright, so you started to think about volunteering in Vietnam, that’s great, but there are many questions that come to your mind probably. If that’s the case, then you’re in a good position since all of that is totally natural. <em>What are the reasons and motivations behind volunteering in Vietnam?</em> First of all, why do you want to travel to Vietnam and volunteer there? Is it a short-term to cut your traveling expenses or you really care about the community and believe you can help them with your skills? Think about it as if you go to Vietnam to volunteer without a purpose, you won’t feel satisfied and your time won’t help much. 2) What about logistics and costs of documentation and program. Please note that almost every program is free and some projects even pay a stipend for volunteers, so don’t pay extra for the program. What about your visa process? Does your volunteering organization support you in visa process and what kind of visa they provide?   3) Which organization you want to be a host of the project you’d like to work on. It’s a crucial question since there are so many organizations that are working just for the sake of money and you will basically help to bring more profits to these organizations. Be sure that you’re collaborating with NGOs who have every information transparent and who’re not putting the profits in their pockets, but really putting the money in the communities.   4) What kind of project you’d like to work on? The majority of projects in Vietnam is about English teaching, but there are many other projects. Be careful with English teaching projects since many project claim they help the poor and underdeveloped communities, but once you come you realize that you’re doing nothing else then putting the money inside the pockets of owners and helping privileged people, while poor still don’t have the access to English lessons. Choose carefully your project and be sure there are many reviews so you can connect with the people who were already working on the project.   5) How long do you plan to volunteer on the project in Vietnam? Well, if you’re planning to work with the kids as an English teacher, it’s important that you stay for longer periods, ideally 6 - 12 months since kids need to form the connection with teachers so they can get the most of the lessons. Also, you can do more harm than good if you’re working with the kids only for a short term.   6) Are your skills really necessary and are you taking the job opportunity from local people by working on a volunteering project? I really advise you to work on the project where your skills can make the difference since working on the other projects can take the job opportunity to a local person! That can do more harm than good!   7) How much money do you need for your stay and will you be able to budget your money correctly? What perks do you get from the organization in exchange for your time?   8) Does the organization offer the contract? Please be careful when reading the contract and always ask as many questions as possible!   Once you have the answers to these questions, I think you’re more than prepared to go over to Vietnam and start making a change.   I literally did an interview with the head of an organization, bought a one-way ticket and fly without any plan and just $200 in my pocket. There were tough times because I didn’t plan anything, but still, it teaches you how to be flexible and it’s not the hardest thing ever in Vietnam!   Don’t be like me and plan things accordingly!   <b>Where to Find a Volunteering Project That Really Makes a Difference?</b>   Once you’ve got all the answers for the questions above and you’ve decided to go to Vietnam to volunteer, it’s important that you find a suitable project for you.   Today, there are many places and platforms filled with volunteering projects, and it’s sometimes very tricky to know which platform or project is reliable. In this section, I will try to give you the guide on finding a reliable project that will really do the lasting impact on the local community.   Please note that I’m not a person with much experience! I’ve been volunteering only in Vietnam on different project related to English teaching and I’ve been using few platforms to find the projects. There are many other opportunities and ways to find a suitable project!   So, I advise you to check out three platforms (not an affiliate nor earning any money from the platforms. These I personally used and believe they are the most accurate):\n<ul>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Workaway which can be found at workaway.info</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helpstay which can be found at helpstay.com</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use different facebook groups for the fastest and most reliable communication with the hosts</li>\n</ul>\nI found my first project on the HelpStay platform when I was mindlessly scrolling around the platform and checking the projects in Vietnam. For the platform, you need to create an account which costs you $30 per year, but you can use the platform without the account. The account gives you the opportunity to outreach hosts and talk to them through the platform. I wrote a comprehensive review on HelpStay, so if you’d like to learn more about the platform, feel free to check it out.   I never subscribed to any platform not because I don’t support the platforms, but because I was totally broke at the time when I was looking for the project and $30 was a lot of money to me that time. The way I did was getting the information on the platform about the organization or host and then doing the further research on Google or Social media about the organizations. Usually, you will find the project and contact information in few minutes which is enough to get in contact with the right person.   The same goes with workaway! I don’t personally use workaway that much, but I’ve met hundreds of people who mainly use workaway for finding their next volunteering project.   I gave a try to workaway when I was traveling around Vietnam with a motorbike since I realized that majority of projects there are kind of short-term and people are using the platform to find a voluntourism opportunity. It works as a charm! It also has a subscription program where you need to get an account, but I’ve never got one. I just used the same strategy as I used for HelpStay.   Also, I wrote a huge review of Workaway, so if you’d like to know more about the platform, feel free to check it out.   In my perspective, Facebook groups are the best and fastest way to find your new volunteering project. The reason for it is that it’s free which means many people are using the platform and it’s transparent since the people posting the projects have the personal accounts they are using on a daily basis.   I suggest you to try these groups: - - - - -   Connect with hosts through Facebook, check their private profiles and organization profiles (website and social media). The best would be if you can get the information on previous or current volunteers so you can connect with them and talk about their experiences. That’s the thing you always want to do - talk with people who were working on the project!   Many organizations will post their projects and tell many good things while supporting a false marketing, but once you come there you will see how different the situation is! To avoid it, just talk with people who have the experience with the organization.   These are three ways I’ve been using when finding a volunteering project in Vietnam (or globally), but there are still other ways how to find a reliable project.   Probably there are crazy good ways to find the best project out there, and if you know it, don’t hesitate to share it with us!   <b>What to Expect From Volunteering in Vietnam?</b>   While volunteering in Vietnam, there are things you should expect to get in return for the time you invest.   The only thing you invest while you’re working on the project should be a time, but on many projects you will also need to invest your money. Also, don’t forget the time, energy and money you invested before coming to Vietnam! You should take all into the account when planning a new volunteering project.   So, when checking the volunteering opportunities in Vietnam, almost every project, which is connected to English teaching, will at least provide you with housing and some meals. Some projects even provide you with a stipend as they support foreigners to travel around Vietnam to experience the country after they finish the projects.   I was working on English teaching project in countryside where I’ve got everything covered; food, accommodation and transportation. It was a very cool experience, and here you can read about it in details.   I literally didn’t need to spend any money there, but in reality, I was spending around $80 per month, mainly on coffee and luxury meals. I was once broke without any money with me and I was living without a penny for 3 weeks. It was manageable, but not the biggest pleasure of my life.   Plan your budget accordingly depending on the place you’re planning to stay, so you avoid the situation when you run out of the money in a foreign country.   Probably you hear this a lot, but, don’t be like Antonio!   The second project I was working at was at cool English speaking cafe in Da Nang city. I stayed there for almost three months and had one of the best experiences of my life. I’ve met amazing people and had some of the best conversations with local people of my life. Also, I’ve learned so much about Vietnam staying at that place. They were offering a dorm room shared with 8 people, but without the meals. It was a fair deal since the food in Da Nang is quite cheap and you only work 4 times per week. It means a lot of free time to explore or work on the side, but you need to seriously plan your budget if you want to do it!   I was talking with some organizations and people who were volunteering for the organizations that claim they provide with stipend, usually $200 monthly, for their volunteers to cover the costs for traveling. Usually, the food and accommodation is paid by the host, but the real question comes when the money is involved.   How reliable it is?   Some people were lucky and they’ve got their money, while many people said there were lot of problems and time spent until they’ve got a portion or whole amount agreed. I personally wouldn’t put my cards on these stipends!   Always ask for a monthly pays and if they start to talk something different than agreed, just find another project!   Also, there are some NGO projects in remote areas that really make change on local community, but during the lack of funds, they ask volunteers for a small daily payments to support themselves.   <b>Actionable Steps to Find Your Next Volunteering Project in Vietnam!</b>   Enough information, let’s get to the real thing! Let’s get your first volunteering project in Vietnam.   Here are actionable steps that will help you in finding a meaningful project in Vietnam:\n<ol>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First things first, think about your reasons and motivation to go to Vietnam at first place. What kind of specific skills do you have and can you devote enough time to really make a difference?</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Register to Workaway or Helpstay or simply just use the platforms to scrape the information. If you don’t want to use any platforms, then Facebook groups will work more than fine. We shared many groups that will help you connect with amazing hosts and projects that make difference to local communities around the country.</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find a reliable project that has a transparent profile and positive reviews from other volunteers. Connect with the head of organization and talk about details of project. Also, don’t forget to connect with previous volunteers as these people will most-likely give you the genuine opinion based on their experience.</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do the interview with the organization and confirm the documentation needed for you to legally volunteer for them. Legit volunteer organizations always sponsor their volunteers with the right visa which is usually a business visa. Vietnam always changes the policies when it comes to foreigners volunteering or working in Vietnam, so the safest would be to have a business visa. Check out what the organization offer you in return for the energy and time you invest into the project.</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you’re happy with the details and confident you’re going to volunteer for a certain project, it’s time to plan your budget depending on the perks of the project. Plan your budget carefully since you don’t want to run out of the money in Vietnam.</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buy a plane ticket and get ready for your next adventure!</li>\n</ol>\nThat’s it! Everything in 6 steps!   It’s not looking like a complicated process, but believe me you will probably spend at least a month just thinking and planning this adventure. There are so many opportunities and options which makes it very hard and tricky to pick the right one.   Don’t worry if you think it takes you much time, you’re not the only one!   Just relax, take your time and plan accordingly.   Wish you all the luck in your next adventure in Vietnam. Once you’re here, don’t forget to send us a message so we can connect and help each other!   Also, if you need a help while looking for a reliable project, I really advise to check out my experience volunteering as an English teacher in rural Vietnam. I can share with you the information and connect you with the right people who can help you to come and work on the same project.   Cheers!', 'All You Need to Know About Volunteering in Vietnam', 'TODO: Write Excerpt\r\n', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '12749-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-04-23 19:07:47', '2020-04-23 19:07:47', '', 12749, 'http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/2020/04/23/12749-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

He has been volunteering on different projects and traveling around the country with the motorbike for the last 9 months and he’s going to share bits of the knowledge with you when it comes to volunteering in Vietnam. So, you’ve decided to volunteer in Vietnam? That’s awesome, but depending on your current country, it’s not a small step since you need to be ready for many sacrifices and a complete change in your lifestyle. Once you’ve got the idea of volunteering in a foreign country, don’t immediately rush to it, but let it stay for a while. Think about it and do the research constantly. If the idea still stays with you after a few months, then volunteering is probably a thing you should do. In this article, I’m going to write about the things you should know before deciding to volunteer in Vietnam. <b>Note: </b>Regulations and laws are constantly changing in Vietnam, so always be sure that you checked everything with your embassy before going to Vietnam. The last thing you want is to be deported from the country where you just wanted to help local community. Believe me, it can happen and it happened to many people before!\n\nhadjuk\n\n<b>Questions to Ask Yourself Before Volunteering in Vietnam</b> Alright, so you started to think about volunteering in Vietnam, that’s great, but there are many questions that come to your mind probably. If that’s the case, then you’re in a good position since all of that is totally natural. <em>What are the reasons and motivations behind volunteering in Vietnam?</em> First of all, why do you want to travel to Vietnam and volunteer there? Is it a short-term to cut your traveling expenses or you really care about the community and believe you can help them with your skills? Think about it as if you go to Vietnam to volunteer without a purpose, you won’t feel satisfied and your time won’t help much. 2) What about logistics and costs of documentation and program. Please note that almost every program is free and some projects even pay a stipend for volunteers, so don’t pay extra for the program. What about your visa process? Does your volunteering organization support you in visa process and what kind of visa they provide?   3) Which organization you want to be a host of the project you’d like to work on. It’s a crucial question since there are so many organizations that are working just for the sake of money and you will basically help to bring more profits to these organizations. Be sure that you’re collaborating with NGOs who have every information transparent and who’re not putting the profits in their pockets, but really putting the money in the communities.   4) What kind of project you’d like to work on? The majority of projects in Vietnam is about English teaching, but there are many other projects. Be careful with English teaching projects since many project claim they help the poor and underdeveloped communities, but once you come you realize that you’re doing nothing else then putting the money inside the pockets of owners and helping privileged people, while poor still don’t have the access to English lessons. Choose carefully your project and be sure there are many reviews so you can connect with the people who were already working on the project.   5) How long do you plan to volunteer on the project in Vietnam? Well, if you’re planning to work with the kids as an English teacher, it’s important that you stay for longer periods, ideally 6 - 12 months since kids need to form the connection with teachers so they can get the most of the lessons. Also, you can do more harm than good if you’re working with the kids only for a short term.   6) Are your skills really necessary and are you taking the job opportunity from local people by working on a volunteering project? I really advise you to work on the project where your skills can make the difference since working on the other projects can take the job opportunity to a local person! That can do more harm than good!   7) How much money do you need for your stay and will you be able to budget your money correctly? What perks do you get from the organization in exchange for your time?   8) Does the organization offer the contract? Please be careful when reading the contract and always ask as many questions as possible!   Once you have the answers to these questions, I think you’re more than prepared to go over to Vietnam and start making a change.   I literally did an interview with the head of an organization, bought a one-way ticket and fly without any plan and just $200 in my pocket. There were tough times because I didn’t plan anything, but still, it teaches you how to be flexible and it’s not the hardest thing ever in Vietnam!   Don’t be like me and plan things accordingly!   <b>Where to Find a Volunteering Project That Really Makes a Difference?</b>   Once you’ve got all the answers for the questions above and you’ve decided to go to Vietnam to volunteer, it’s important that you find a suitable project for you.   Today, there are many places and platforms filled with volunteering projects, and it’s sometimes very tricky to know which platform or project is reliable.

You should take all into the account when planning a new volunteering project.   So, when checking the volunteering opportunities in Vietnam, almost every project, which is connected to English teaching, will at least provide you with housing and some meals. Some projects even provide you with a stipend as they support foreigners to travel around Vietnam to experience the country after they finish the projects.   I was working on English teaching project in countryside where I’ve got everything covered; food, accommodation and transportation. It was a very cool experience, and here you can read about it in details.   I literally didn’t need to spend any money there, but in reality, I was spending around $80 per month, mainly on coffee and luxury meals. I was once broke without any money with me and I was living without a penny for 3 weeks. It was manageable, but not the biggest pleasure of my life.   Plan your budget accordingly depending on the place you’re planning to stay, so you avoid the situation when you run out of the money in a foreign country.   Probably you hear this a lot, but, don’t be like Antonio!   The second project I was working at was at cool English speaking cafe in Da Nang city. I stayed there for almost three months and had one of the best experiences of my life. I’ve met amazing people and had some of the best conversations with local people of my life. Also, I’ve learned so much about Vietnam staying at that place. They were offering a dorm room shared with 8 people, but without the meals. It was a fair deal since the food in Da Nang is quite cheap and you only work 4 times per week. It means a lot of free time to explore or work on the side, but you need to seriously plan your budget if you want to do it!   I was talking with some organizations and people who were volunteering for the organizations that claim they provide with stipend, usually $200 monthly, for their volunteers to cover the costs for traveling. Usually, the food and accommodation is paid by the host, but the real question comes when the money is involved.   How reliable it is?   Some people were lucky and they’ve got their money, while many people said there were lot of problems and time spent until they’ve got a portion or whole amount agreed. I personally wouldn’t put my cards on these stipends!   Always ask for a monthly pays and if they start to talk something different than agreed, just find another project!   Also, there are some NGO projects in remote areas that really make change on local community, but during the lack of funds, they ask volunteers for a small daily payments to support themselves.   <b>Actionable Steps to Find Your Next Volunteering Project in Vietnam!</b>   Enough information, let’s get to the real thing! Let’s get your first volunteering project in Vietnam.   Here are actionable steps that will help you in finding a meaningful project in Vietnam:\n<ol>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First things first, think about your reasons and motivation to go to Vietnam at first place. What kind of specific skills do you have and can you devote enough time to really make a difference?</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Register to Workaway or Helpstay or simply just use the platforms to scrape the information. If you don’t want to use any platforms, then Facebook groups will work more than fine. We shared many groups that will help you connect with amazing hosts and projects that make difference to local communities around the country.</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find a reliable project that has a transparent profile and positive reviews from other volunteers. Connect with the head of organization and talk about details of project. Also, don’t forget to connect with previous volunteers as these people will most-likely give you the genuine opinion based on their experience.</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do the interview with the organization and confirm the documentation needed for you to legally volunteer for them. Legit volunteer organizations always sponsor their volunteers with the right visa which is usually a business visa. Vietnam always changes the policies when it comes to foreigners volunteering or working in Vietnam, so the safest would be to have a business visa. Check out what the organization offer you in return for the energy and time you invest into the project.</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you’re happy with the details and confident you’re going to volunteer for a certain project, it’s time to plan your budget depending on the perks of the project. Plan your budget carefully since you don’t want to run out of the money in Vietnam.</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buy a plane ticket and get ready for your next adventure!</li>\n</ol>\nThat’s it! Everything in 6 steps!   It’s not looking like a complicated process, but believe me you will probably spend at least a month just thinking and planning this adventure. There are so many opportunities and options which makes it very hard and tricky to pick the right one.   Don’t worry if you think it takes you much time, you’re not the only one!   Just relax, take your time and plan accordingly.   Wish you all the luck in your next adventure in Vietnam. Once you’re here, don’t forget to send us a message so we can connect and help each other!   Also, if you need a help while looking for a reliable project, I really advise to check out my experience volunteering as an English teacher in rural Vietnam. I can share with you the information and connect you with the right people who can help you to come and work on the same project.   Cheers!', 'All You Need to Know About Volunteering in Vietnam', 'TODO: Write Excerpt\r\n', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '12749-revision-v1', '', '', '2020-04-23 19:18:19', '2020-04-23 19:18:19', '', 12749, 'http://localhost/vietnam_chronicles/2020/04/23/12749-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

He has been volunteering on different projects and traveling around the country with the motorbike for the last 9 months and he’s going to share bits of the knowledge with you when it comes to volunteering in Vietnam. So, you’ve decided to volunteer in Vietnam? That’s awesome, but depending on your current country, it’s not a small step since you need to be ready for many sacrifices and a complete change in your lifestyle. Once you’ve got the idea of volunteering in a foreign country, don’t immediately rush to it, but let it stay for a while. Think about it and do the research constantly. If the idea still stays with you after a few months, then volunteering is probably a thing you should do. In this article, I’m going to write about the things you should know before deciding to volunteer in Vietnam. <b>Note: </b>Regulations and laws are constantly changing in Vietnam, so always be sure that you checked everything with your embassy before going to Vietnam. The last thing you want is to be deported from the country where you just wanted to help local community. Believe me, it can happen and it happened to many people before!\n\n<b>Questions to Ask Yourself Before Volunteering in Vietnam</b> Alright, so you started to think about volunteering in Vietnam, that’s great, but there are many questions that come to your mind probably. If that’s the case, then you’re in a good position since all of that is totally natural. <em>What are the reasons and motivations behind volunteering in Vietnam?</em> First of all, why do you want to travel to Vietnam and volunteer there? Is it a short-term to cut your traveling expenses or you really care about the community and believe you can help them with your skills? Think about it as if you go to Vietnam to volunteer without a purpose, you won’t feel satisfied and your time won’t help much. 2) What about logistics and costs of documentation and program. Please note that almost every program is free and some projects even pay a stipend for volunteers, so don’t pay extra for the program. What about your visa process? Does your volunteering organization support you in visa process and what kind of visa they provide?   3) Which organization you want to be a host of the project you’d like to work on. It’s a crucial question since there are so many organizations that are working just for the sake of money and you will basically help to bring more profits to these organizations. Be sure that you’re collaborating with NGOs who have every information transparent and who’re not putting the profits in their pockets, but really putting the money in the communities.   4) What kind of project you’d like to work on? The majority of projects in Vietnam is about English teaching, but there are many other projects. Be careful with English teaching projects since many project claim they help the poor and underdeveloped communities, but once you come you realize that you’re doing nothing else then putting the money inside the pockets of owners and helping privileged people, while poor still don’t have the access to English lessons. Choose carefully your project and be sure there are many reviews so you can connect with the people who were already working on the project.   5) How long do you plan to volunteer on the project in Vietnam? Well, if you’re planning to work with the kids as an English teacher, it’s important that you stay for longer periods, ideally 6 - 12 months since kids need to form the connection with teachers so they can get the most of the lessons. Also, you can do more harm than good if you’re working with the kids only for a short term.   6) Are your skills really necessary and are you taking the job opportunity from local people by working on a volunteering project? I really advise you to work on the project where your skills can make the difference since working on the other projects can take the job opportunity to a local person! That can do more harm than good!   7) How much money do you need for your stay and will you be able to budget your money correctly? What perks do you get from the organization in exchange for your time?   8) Does the organization offer the contract? Please be careful when reading the contract and always ask as many questions as possible!   Once you have the answers to these questions, I think you’re more than prepared to go over to Vietnam and start making a change.   I literally did an interview with the head of an organization, bought a one-way ticket and fly without any plan and just $200 in my pocket. There were tough times because I didn’t plan anything, but still, it teaches you how to be flexible and it’s not the hardest thing ever in Vietnam!   Don’t be like me and plan things accordingly!   <b>Where to Find a Volunteering Project That Really Makes a Difference?</b>   Once you’ve got all the answers for the questions above and you’ve decided to go to Vietnam to volunteer, it’s important that you find a suitable project for you.   Today, there are many places and platforms filled with volunteering projects, and it’s sometimes very tricky to know which platform or project is reliable. In this section, I will try to give you the guide on finding a reliable project that will really do the lasting impact on the local community.   Please note that I’m not a person with much experience! I’ve been volunteering only in Vietnam on different project related to English teaching and I’ve been using few platforms to find the projects. There are many other opportunities and ways to find a suitable project!   So, I advise you to check out three platforms (not an affiliate nor earning any money from the platforms. These I personally used and believe they are the most accurate):\n<ul>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Workaway which can be found at workaway.info</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helpstay which can be found at helpstay.com</li>\n 	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use different facebook groups for the fastest and most reliable communication with the hosts</li>\n</ul>\nI found my first project on the HelpStay platform when I was mindlessly scrolling around the platform and checking the projects in Vietnam. For the platform, you need to create an account which costs you $30 per year, but you can use the platform without the account. The account gives you the opportunity to outreach hosts and talk to them through the platform. I wrote a comprehensive review on HelpStay, so if you’d like to learn more about the platform, feel free to check it out.   I never subscribed to any platform not because I don’t support the platforms, but because I was totally broke at the time when I was looking for the project and $30 was a lot of money to me that time. The way I did was getting the information on the platform about the organization or host and then doing the further research on Google or Social media about the organizations. Usually, you will find the project and contact information in few minutes which is enough to get in contact with the right person.   The same goes with workaway! I don’t personally use workaway that much, but I’ve met hundreds of people who mainly use workaway for finding their next volunteering project.   I gave a try to workaway when I was traveling around Vietnam with a motorbike since I realized that majority of projects there are kind of short-term and people are using the platform to find a voluntourism opportunity. It works as a charm! It also has a subscription program where you need to get an account, but I’ve never got one. I just used the same strategy as I used for HelpStay.   Also, I wrote a huge review of Workaway, so if you’d like to know more about the platform, feel free to check it out.   In my perspective, Facebook groups are the best and fastest way to find your new volunteering project. The reason for it is that it’s free which means many people are using the platform and it’s transparent since the people posting the projects have the personal accounts they are using on a daily basis.   I suggest you to try these groups: - - - - -   Connect with hosts through Facebook, check their private profiles and organization profiles (website and social media). The best would be if you can get the information on previous or current volunteers so you can connect with them and talk about their experiences. That’s the thing you always want to do - talk with people who were working on the project!   Many organizations will post their projects and tell many good things while supporting a false marketing, but once you come there you will see how different the situation is! To avoid it, just talk with people who have the experience with the organization.   These are three ways I’ve been using when finding a volunteering project in Vietnam (or globally), but there are still other ways how to find a reliable project.   Probably there are crazy good ways to find the best project out there, and if you know it, don’t hesitate to share it with us!   <b>What to Expect From Volunteering in Vietnam?</b>   While volunteering in Vietnam, there are things you should expect to get in return for the time you invest.   The only thing you invest while you’re working on the project should be a time, but on many projects you will also need to invest your money.
